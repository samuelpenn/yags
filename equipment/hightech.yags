                I never thought that I would ever be wealthy enough

            <para>
                Through a process that began in the 17th century, and began to
                accelerate in the 19th, it wasn't really until the 20th
                century that the pace of technological advancement began to
                make massive changes to the way people lived within a single
                generation. The early 20th century saw the first air planes,
                the mechanisation of warfare, the mass production of cars
                and instantaneous long distance communication coming into the
                hands of the masses.
            </para>

            <para>
                <tm>Yags High Tech</tm> covers the equipment available during
                the period from the early 20th century (Technology Level 6)
                through to the early 21st century (TL 8). Though it is barely
                more than 100 years, there is a huge change in the type of
                items available. However, they are all close enough to the
                present to be considered <e>Modern</e>, and for most people to
                have a vague understanding of what these periods in history
                were like.
            </para>

            <para>
                <tm>High Tech</tm> concerns itself mostly with those things
                that require in-game statistics, such as weapons and vehicles.
                Since vehicles become so predominant during these periods,
                a detailed set of rules on the use of vehicles within
                <tm>Yags</tm> are also included.

                <para>
                    The technology levels in <tm>Yags</tm> are meant as a
                    rough guide as to when an item, skill or knowledge becomes
                    available for use within the game. The date ranges given
                    are based on 'Western Civilisation', and there is always
                    a certain fuzziness around the transition from one period
                    to the next.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Though Europe and North America are currently TL 8, there
                    are still TL 0 (stone age) civilisations in the world, and
                    many smaller countries might still be classed as TL 7, or
                    even TL 6.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The technology level defines the base level of technology
                    that a culture can support itself, and may be radically
                    different from the technology actually available. There
                    are many African nations where mobile phones are a common
                    means of communicating and where farmers regularly look
                    up grain prices on the internet, but the TL of the culture
                    itself may be 2 or 3. Just because they don't have the
                    knowledge to build a steam engine, doesn't mean they can't
                    make use of (or even know how to repair) high tech equipment
                    purchased from others.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Where prices are given, they are given for the TL when
                    the item was introduced. Most items will reduce in price
                    at later TLs, though if they become generally unavailable
                    then prices may well increase.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Prices are given in USD, again at time of introduction.

                    <title>TL 6 - The Age of Machines</title>

                    <para>
                        Covering the period from 1900 to 1945, TL 6 sees the
                        introduction of cars and planes on a scale which
                        affects the lives of everyone.
                    </para>

                    <image src="images/tl6-characters.jpg" align="right" width="4cm"/>

                    <para>
                        From the point of view of being the setting for a
                        campaign, TL 6 has a number of unique advantages.
                        Firstly, it has just the right amount of technology
                        to allow things to be possible, without it being
                        quite prevalent enough to close down other options.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Communication around the world is possible, but
                        possible to prevent on a regular basis without
                        stretching disbelief. Fast air travel exists, but
                        is limited. In America, you have the extremes of
                        high society and abject poverty rubbing shoulders
                        with each other. Two world wars provide plenty of
                        plot hooks, and the '30s provide obvious villains
                        in the form of the Nazis.

                    <para>
                        The first atomic bomb was detonated in 1945, and
                        signifies the start of TL 7. Atomic energy was not
                        the only defining characteristic of TL 7 however.
                        Space travel, computers and the wide adoption of
                        television also changed culture considerably.

                        Science Fiction of TL 7 saw computers as becoming
                        bigger and more powerful, but mostly failed to
                        predict them becoming smaller and cheaper.

            <para>
                The variety of ways in which people can kill each other
                is quite staggering, and the arms industry seems to do
                well regardless of the state of the economy. Whilst
                <tm>Yags</tm> tries to capture some of the flavour of
                the various types of death dealing items of equipment,
                it shouldn't be seen as a full list of everything that
                has been available throughout the modern period.
            </para>

            <para>
                What <tm>Yags High Tech</tm> does try to do is capture
                a sample of the different <e>kinds</e> of weapons, and
                try to model them in a semi-realistic fashion. A top
                down approach to realism is what is aimed for - as long
                as the rules give the same sort of result as what may
                be expected in real life, <tm>Yags</tm> doesn't worry
                too much about the exact way in which this is modelled.

                <para>
                    The number of statistics for each weapon can be
                    quite daunting, but they are all there for a reason.
                    The least obvious are the codes listed in the
                    weapon notes. They all have specific meanings which
                    are consistent across genres and settings. The main
                    purpose is to give a different feel for different
                    weapons, and to make them useful in different
                    circumstances.

                            burst consist of 10 rounds. If a number is specified,

                    For much of the high tech period however, armour has lagged
                    behind since it has been difficult to make armour effective
                    enough to stop high velocity bullets which is light enough
                    to be wearable on a modern battlefield.

                            armour can have a secondary effect against firearms,
                            reducing the effectiveness of the attack.

                            which is more than 5 Size points larger than the target
                            also ignores this.

            <title>The Great Wars (TL6)</title>

            <para>
                Here we consider weapons commonly available during TL6,
                which includes both WWI and WWII. WWI saw the development
                of machine guns and trench warfare which invented far
                more effective ways of killing people, and WWII developed
                things about as far as you could go without the use of
                advanced computers and electronics.

                    period from WWI to WWII.

                    This is the end of TL 6, and saw the development
                    of many technologies that would become the basis
                    for TL 7. The late war years are pretty much on
                    the cusp of TL 6/TL 7, but are considered to be
                    late TL 6 rather than early TL 7.

            <title>The Cold War (TL7)</title>

            <para>
                World War II had spurred the development of new technologies
                that became the defining achievements of TL7. Computers,
                electronics, nuclear power and space flight all become
                achievable and even in common everyday use, bringing about
                some of the greatest changes in technology never before
                witnessed.
            </para>

            <para>
                With the advent of the Cold War, both Russia and America had
                the opportunity to engage in an arms race and indirect conflict
                which caused no end of suffering, but which provides plenty
                of opportunity for gaming.

            <para>
                From 1980 to 2020, TL 8 covers the present day. Huge
                advancements in computer technology become apparent to
                the general population over this period, as communications
                and information technology begin to reform society.
            </para>

            <para>
                Computer assistance makes its way into vehicles and weapons,
                and remotely operated drones make the battle field safer
                (for those who have the drones). As the threat of full scale
                nuclear war diminishes, so small scale tactical weapons
                are favoured over massive destructive ability.

                    The reliability and killing power of small arms doesn't

                    making things lighter and improving personal protection.

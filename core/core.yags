            <title>What is Yags?</title>

            <para>
                <e>Yags is Another Game System</e>, one that is meant to
                provide a free, generic and modular set of rules for table
                top roleplaying. These rules do not describe what a role
                playing game is, or how to play one - it is assumed that
                you have played other RPGs before, and are either looking
                for something different, or simply want to flick through
                looking for rules to borrow for your own games.
            </para>

            <para>
                <s>Yags</s> is split into a number of articles, of which
                this - <e>Core</e> - is the first. Each article provides
                detail on a different facet of the game, and two others
                - <e>Character</e> and <e>Combat</e> are recommended
                reading before running a game. Other articles are optional,
                and generally provide more detailed rules for a given
                setting, environment or situation.
            </para>

            <para>
                The articles are split into five main subject areas,
                which are differentiated by colour:
            </para>

            <itemlist order="strict">
                <item name="Core Rules (orange)">
                    Basic rules, from simple task resolution to expanded
                    coverage of skills and environments. Most will be
                    setting neutral.
                </item>

                <item name="Character (green)">
                    Includes character generation and advancement,
                    skills, advantages and disadvantages and anything
                    else to do with defining a character.
                </item>

                <item name="Conflict (red)">
                    Mostly covers combat and other forms of conflict.
                </item>

                <item name="Catalogue (black)">
                    Any article which is just a description of items,
                    such as an equipment list or a bestiary.
                </item>

                <item name="Supernatural (blue)">
                    Anything magical or divine is covered under the
                    <e>Supernatural</e> category. The basic rules do not
                    cover the supernatural, so these will nearly always
                    be setting specific.
                </item>
            </itemlist>

            <para>
                This then, is the core of the <e>Core Rules</e>, on which
                everything else is based. However, you don't need to read
                this first - if you just want to generate a character,
                then start with <e>Characters</e>, which gives a quick
                overview of the basics before showing you how to create a
                new character. This article is mostly of use to
                <e>Game Masters</e> who need a good understanding of how
                the rules work, and how they relate to things in the
                real world.
            </para>

                All these rules are available for download from the

            <sect2>
                <title>Genre and style</title>

                <para>
                    <e>Yags</e> is designed to be generic, which means it's
                    not really aimed at any single setting or type of game.
                    At one point or another it has been used for fantasy,
                    science fiction and modern horror gaming. However, the
                    game rules do to some extent encourage a certain style
                    of game, and Yags is no exception.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The system is grounded in realistic low fantasy. Bullets
                    and swords can kill a hero as easily as they can kill a
                    shopkeeper. The random element of skills is relatively
                    small compared to the range of ability available, so an
                    inexperienced character can't rely on luck to beat an
                    experience character at a contest of skills. Similarly,
                    a gifted novice won't beat a more average professional -
                    raw talent doesn't always make up for lack of experience,
                    but it sure does help you once you get that experience.
                </para>

                <para>
                    However, the low randomness does mean that highly skilled
                    individuals can be very, very good, and it is possible to
                    build truly heroic individuals (such as a vengeful bride
                    or blind swordmaster) who can survive against silly odds
                    as long as they are careful.

                    <e>Yags</e> is Free content. This does not mean that
                    you do not need to pay to download it (though you don't),
                    but that you are free to do what you want with the rules
                    under the terms of the GPL version 2 (just like the
                    free operating system Linux for example). This means that
                    you have:

                        for this.

                        improvements to the public, so that the whole
                        community benefits. Access to the preferred form
                        for modification is a precondition for this.

                <para>
                    This does mean you may republish (or even sell) these
                    rules yourself, even if you have modified them. The
                    only limitation is that all published versions of
                    these rules (including modifications) must also be
                    published under the GPL version 2, and that editable,
                    electronic versions must be provided as source.

                    <para>
                        A rules system that is Free to modify and distribute
                        can be tailored for use by a group to match their
                        own playing styles. Gamers do this anyway, but Yags
                        is designed to make this easy. If you disagree with
                        the stats for a particular weapon, or how a skill
                        works, you can modify the original document and
                        print your own version of the rules - no more need
                        for scribbled notes in rule books, or pages of
                        extra sheets noting the changes and hoping everybody
                        remembers what has been changed.

                        Yags uses the GPL, which means <e>all</e> of the
                        content is free, and cannot be mixed with non-free
                        content. This is different from licenses like the
                        <e>Open Gaming License</e> which allows closed
                        content to be mixed with open content, making it
                        impossible to redistribute a complete set of

            <title>The Core Mechanics</title>

            <para>
                <s>Yags</s> has a relatively simple set of basic rules
                which form the core of the rest of the system. These rules
                will remain consistent across all genres and settings.

                <title>Terminology</title>

                <para>
                    The following terminology is used throughout the
                    <s>Yags</s> rules. Where these terms are used, the
                    specific definitions given here are what is meant.
                </para>

                <itemlist order="sort">
                    <item name="Attribute">
                        One of the eight basic numbers which define any
                        creature in Yags. A typical adult human has a
                        score of 3 in all their attributes. Attributes
                        are combined with a skill to determine a
                        creature's ability at a task.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Skill">
                        A skill defines a creature's training and
                        experience in a narrow field. Skills are combined
                        with attributes to determine a creature's ability
                        at a task. A competent level of skill is 4 or more.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Ability">
                        A creature's ability to achieve success in a task
                        is equal to an attribute multiplied by a skill, or
                        an attribute multiplied by 4 for a raw attribute check.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Score">
                        The raw numerical value of any characteristic,
                        unmodified by anything else. A skill score would
                        be a creature's rating in a skill, before it is
                        multiplied by an attribute.

                    <item name="Task">
                        An activity that requires an ability check.

                    <item name="Die">
                        A single twenty sided die, a d20.

                <para>
                    When you (as a character) perform an action in <s>Yags</s>
                    you will not normally have to make a die roll. Attempting
                    a difficult task, or a simple task under stressful or
                    rushed conditions may require that you make an ability
                    check. An ability check is used to determine both whether
                    you succeed and also how well you succeed.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The GM should determine the most suitable <e>attribute</e>
                    and <e>skill</e> combination to use, and set a target
                    level for the task. <e>Very easy</e> tasks have a target
                    of 10, <e>moderate</e> tasks have a target of 20 and
                    <e>difficult</e> tasks have a target of 30. In some cases
                    you may need to make a check just against an attribute
                    (for example, a <e>Health</e> check to remain conscious)
                    where no skill is involved.

                <para flag="green">
                    To make a skill check, you roll <s>Attribute</s> x
                    <s>Skill</s> + 1d20, and if it equals or exceeds the
                    target difficulty then you succeed.

                    the target difficulty then you succeed.

                <para>
                    If it is important how well you succeed, then every 10
                    points by which you beat the target is considered an
                    extra level of success. Simply beating the target is
                    considered a <e>moderate</e> success, beating it by
                    10 or more is a <e>good</e> success (2 levels), by 20
                    or more is <e>excellent</e> and 30+ is <e>fantastic</e>.

                        Multiplication of stats is rare in roleplaying games,
                        but it has its advantages. Multiplication ensures
                        that both the attribute and the skill are important.
                        A single high attribute will not allow you to be
                        automatically better than everyone else at related

                    Sometimes, a skill contest is called for between two or

                    a set target number, you try to beat your opponent's

                        the die represents automatic failure or a fumble.
                        In some situations, the chance of a fumble may be
                        higher than this (e.g., a roll of 1-3 might be a
                        fumble).

                    <para>
                        Normally, a roll of 20 on the die is nothing
                        special. If a character rolls a 20 when making a
                        contested skill check against another character,
                        and their skill level (i.e., not their skill x
                        attribute) is higher than the second
                        character's, then they automatically win.

                        When a character achieves a skill of four, then a

                        any non-opposed situation which is predictable,
                        and where their ability is equal or higher than the
                        target difficulty, then they can take an automatic

                        A narrow ledge above a pool of larva would count
                        as long as there was no wind and the ledge was
                        stable. If there was a high wind, then it becomes
                        unpredictable and a roll is required (though the
                        character still only fumbles on a '1').

                        Alternatively, if the situation is non-stressful
                        (a narrow ledge above a pool of larva is always
                        considered stressful), and there is time to think
                        about the task beforehand, then the die roll can be
                        considered to be an automatic '10'. Picking a lock
                        or making a sword are examples of non-stressful
                        situations. Picking a lock whilst people are
                        fighting around you would be stressful however.

                As with many game systems, <s>Yags</s> measures the ability
                of a character in the game using numerical stats, normally
                either <e>attributes</e> or <e>skills</e>. These numbers
                don't relate directly to anything in the real world - they
                are simply convienient.
            </para>

            <para>
                To simplify things, these numbers can be used to measure
                people, animals, vehicles, buildings and almost anything

                mettle against.

                <para>
                    Attributes are the basic characteristics of all creatures
                    in <s>Yags</s>, and are a broad measure of natural talent
                    and potential. There are eight primary attributes -
                    strength, health, agility, dexterity, perception,
                    intelligence, empathy and will - and two secondary
                    attributes - size and move.
                </para>

                <para>
                    These attributes are consistent across all settings and
                    genres, and always work in the same way. The distribution
                    of values may vary. A fantasy setting with a rigid caste
                    system will have few examples of high attributes simply
                    because of the small numbers of people, the lack of
                    formalised training and inability for gifted people to
                    take up a role befitting their ability. A science fiction
                    setting with a population in the trillions, where people
                    are free to take the job they are best suited for, will
                    have more examples of gifted individuals which the PCs
                    will meet.

                    <para>
                        For humans, attributes tend to range between two
                        and five. Higher values are possible, but rare.
                        The following chart describes the different levels
                        from the point of view of an adult human.
                        Non-human creatures may work on different scales,
                        especially for strength which tends to be much
                        higher for large animals.

                        attributes. For humans, scores above five are
                        gained through lots of training and experience -
                        they are not gained due to a chance of birth.

                    A skill is something which can be learnt and improved
                    through experience and training. Except for a few basic
                    skills, they always default to zero unless specifically
                    learnt. If a skill is zero, then it either can't be used
                    (in the case of many knowledge or science skills), can
                    default to another skill, or is rolled as a straight d20
                    halved (round down).

                    In some settings, it may be possible to learn skills
                    almost immediately, through cyborg implants or because
                    the world is some sort of simulation. It is highly
                    suggested that skills above four are highly difficulty
                    to obtain in such a way.

                        Once a skill is learnt, it's level ranges from one
                        upwards. There is no theoretical limit to how high
                        your skill can be, though a practical limit is in the
                        range of 10-15. Skills higher than 15 are considered
                        to be <e>mythical</e> - in the realm of supernatural
                        or transended beings.

                    How large a creature is can be measured in a number of
                    ways - height, length and mass being the common criteria.
                    In <s>Yags</s>, the <t>Size</t> attribute is a measure
                    of the creature's capacity to absorb damage, and how easy
                    it is to hit. In general, the <t>Size</t> of a creature
                    will increase logarithmically with its mass - every +5
                    increase in <t>Size</t> represents a ten fold increase
                    in mass.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Adult humans range in <t>Size</t> from 4 (a small, slim
                    woman) to 6 (a heavyweight boxer or stereotypical Norse
                    warrior). Anything other than the default of 5 represents
                    the extreme edge of human variation. The biggest effect
                    it has is to provide a little bit more (or less) capacity
                    to resist damage. The default character generation rules
                    also put upper and lower limits on <t>Strength</t> for
                    noticeably large or small characters.

                    Each point of <t>Size</t> allows a creature (including PCs)
                    to take one wound before dying. A warhorse can take about
                    twice as much damage as a man, an elephant about 3 times.
                    The details are a bit more complex (small weapons have less
                    effect on large targets) however, and a full description of
                    how wounds and damage works is left for the <s>Combat</s>

                <para>
                    <e>Vehicles</e> and other constructs are actually treated a
                    little differently from creatures, in that their <t>Size</t>
                    is actually based on the volume of the vehicle, rather than
                    its mass. Obtaining real-world figures for the mass of animals
                    is quite simple, but volumes are rarely given. Finding the
                    volume of a vehicle or building is relatively straightforward,
                    but finding a sensible value for its mass can be hard
                    (especially when a vehicle's mass can change drastically
                    depending on whether it is empty or loaded). However, creatures
                    and vehicles should approximate to the same <t>Size</t> for any
                    given size. A <t>Size</t> 5 vehicle is assumed to be one cubic
                    metre, again increasing by a factor of 10 for each +5.

                    The ability to absorb damage is also slightly different for

                    less effective against vehicles, but again this is described

                    <para>
                        A character can move a distance in metres equal to half
                        their <e>Move</e> score (round down) each round of
                        combat without any penalty. For an average person, this
                        is 6m/round. This is normally considered a free action.

                            over long distance. Moving this far in combat
                            counts as an action, and restricts what else the

            <para>
                There are eight core skills in <tm>Yags</tm>, which are
                called <e>Talents</e>. These are known by virtually all
                characters (at least, human ones), since they represent
                basic ability. These skills are described in the general
                skill lists, but what follows is a very detailed look
                at how these skills can be used.
            </para>

            <para>
                It should be noted that the following is rules heavy, and
                in some cases may be best use as guidelines rather than
                hard and fast rules (even more so than normal). A lot of
                what is described are core activities - such as running,
                fast talking, spotting things and the like.
            </para>

            <para>
                When looking at skill difficulties, it should be remembered
                that for these skills, the majority of people will have an
                ability of 6 (3 x 2) - an average roll of 17. A skill check
                of <e>moderate</e> difficulty will be failed 65% of the
                time.

                        Racing across clear terrain with nothing in your way
                        is considered trivial, and you don't need to make a

                        dodge through crowds of people on a broken and icy

                        climbing a ladder or flight of stairs will rarely

                        <para>
                            When climbing things which require more than a
                            round to complete, the difficulty is more based
                            on the complexity of the task than the time it
                            takes to complete.

                        <para>
                            Normally, you can speed climb a distance equal
                            to quarter your <t>Move</t> each round. Make a
                            <y:strength>Athletics</y:strength> check each
                            round, failure means no distance is climbed, and
                            make an <y:agility>Athletics</y:agility> check at
                            the same difficulty or fall. Alternatively, the
                            second check can be ignored if you take a level
                            of <e>Fatigue</e>.

                        <para>
                            Optionally, you can move ten times this distance
                            every minute, making a check each minute. This is
                            slower, but reduces the number of rolls and hence
                            the chance of fumbling.

                        <para>
                            For longer climbs, a roll every 15 minutes can be
                            made, at <t>Move</t> x 50. Again, speed is traded
                            for reliability. Over these distances, a failure
                            can be ignored by gaining a level of

                    The purpose of <e>Guile</e> is to deceive others, whether
                    it is by direct lying or misdirection. <e>Guile</e> is
                    also used to determine if others are lying. It uses a
                    wide variety of attributes, depending on what you are
                    attempting to do.

                        Simple lying requires a <y:will>guile</y:will> check
                        against the opponent's <y:empathy>guile</y:empathy>.
                        It basically entails keeping calm, not saying more
                        than you should and not showing your true emotions.

                    <para>
                        This assumes that you are trying to keep things
                        simple, and restricting the information you are
                        providing.

                        Obviously, if you wish to tell if someone is lying,
                        then you make the <t>Empathy</t> check, and they
                        make the <t>Will</t> check. If you exceed their roll,
                        then you know if they are lying or telling the truth.
                        If you fail, then you will randomly think they are
                        being truthful or liars. If the target's roll was
                        positive, you think they are truthful, otherwise you
                        think they are lying. Neither party knows whether they
                        succeeded or not.

                        a <e>good</e> success, then you are certain they are
                        telling the truth so this doesn't necessarily help.

                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                    your programs, too.

                <para>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                </para>

                <para>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                </para>

                <para>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                    rights.
                </para>

                <para>
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                    distribute and/or modify the software.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                    authors' reputations.

                <para>
                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

                    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                </para>

                <para>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
                </para>

                <para>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                    along with the Program.
                </para>

                <para>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
                </para>

                <para>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                </para>

                <para>
                        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                </para>

                <para>
                        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                        parties under the terms of this License.
                </para>

                <para>
                        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                </para>

                <para>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Program.
                </para>

                <para>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                </para>

                <para>
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
                </para>

                <para>
                        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
                </para>

                <para>
                        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                        customarily used for software interchange; or,
                </para>

                <para>
                        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                        received the program in object code or executable form with such
                        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                </para>

                <para>
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                    itself accompanies the executable.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                </para>

                <para>
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                    parties remain in full compliance.
                </para>

                <para>
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Program or works based on it.
                </para>

                <para>
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                    this License.
                </para>

                <para>
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgement or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                    circumstances.
                </para>

                <para>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                </para>

                <para>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                </para>

                <para>
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                </para>

                <para>
                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                    address new problems or concerns.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                    Foundation.
                </para>

                <para>
                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                <para>
                    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

                    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

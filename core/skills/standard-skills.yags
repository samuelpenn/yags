            <para>
                This is a broad skill covering all forms of athletics,
                gymnastics and acrobatics. It is split into the following
                tasks.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml" task="Running">
            <para>
                Running represents a light jog which you can keep up for
                many minutes without too much difficulty. When running,
                you move a number of metres each round equal to your
                <t>move</t> score. A point of fatigue is gained every
                <y:health>athletics</y:health> minutes you are running.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml" task="Sprinting">
            <para>
                Sprinting represents an all out sprint, moving as quickly
                as you can. You cannot do anything else whilst sprinting,
                and most people can only sprint for a few rounds before
                becoming exhausted.
            </para>

            <para>
                When sprinting, you may move a distance in metres equal to
                <t>move</t> x 2 + <e>athletics</e> each round, and gain a
                point of fatigue each round.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                This skill is used by the character when there is a chance
                of noticing something which isn't obvious, such as someone
                trying to sneak around, people moving at a distance, or
                looking for a secret door. If the character is asleep,
                then any awareness rolls are quartered. If the character
                is only dozing (or day dreaming), then rolls are halved.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                A general purpose combat skill covering dodging, punching
                and wrestling. This is covered in more detail in the combat
                section. It allows the use of small weapons such as knives
                and daggers, as well as improvised weapons such as stones,
                bottles, sticks and chairs.
            </para>

            <para>
                A character may always use the <e>brawl</e> skill to dodge
                even if they are using a weapon, but they don't get any
                bonuses from the weapon if they do so.

        <short>Being nice to people.</short>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                <e>Charm</e> is all about appearing friendly and sociable,
                and can be used to make people like you and act favourably
                towards you. It is nearly always based on <t>Empathy</t>,
                since you need to be able to react to how the other person
                is perceiving you.
            </para>

            <para>
                At its simplest, a simple <y:empathy>Charm</y:empathy>
                check determines what another thinks of you. As long as
                you get a <e>Very easy</e> success, then you'll get a
                <e>Neutral</e> reaction, assuming they have no other
                reason to dislike you. A <e>Moderate</e> success will
                give a <e>Good</e> reaction, and a <e>Difficult</e>
                success will give an <e>Excellent</e> reaction.
            </para>

            <para>
                <e>Charm</e> can also be used to improve a second social
                skill test (such as <e>Guile</e>, <e>Trade</e> or
                <e>Perform</e>). Make a <y:empathy>Charm</y:empathy> check
                against the <y:will/> of the target to gain a +3 bonus for
                each level of success.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml" task="Carousing">
            <para>
                Used at parties and similar social gatherings. Can be used
                to find out information, flirt or try and talk to someone
                who might be otherwise difficult to talk to (such as a duke
                surrounded by hangers-on and aids who won't let anyone else
                near him, or just an attractive and popular girl similarly
                protected). Generally not resisted.

                Mindless chatter to try and draw information out of
                someone, or to simply distract them. Generally not
                resisted, unless the target is being deliberately close
                mouthed about a subject.

            <para>
                <e>Guile</e> allows a character to use and understand
                social methods of deception, through lying, body language
                and actions. A character can lie by making an opposed

                <y:empathy>guile</y:empathy>. Success means that the target

                circumstances based on how probably the lie is.
            </para>

                For hurled improvised weapons, short range is considered
                to be four times strength, medium twice this, and long
                range twice medium.

                The simplist way to find the winner for a game, is for
                both opponents to roll their skill, and the highest roll
                wins. If it is desired to play out the game in more
                detail, then proceed as follows.

                Each opponent makes a skill check each turn of the game.
                If one exceeds the other by five or more, then they gain
                an advantage. Each advantage gained gives +3 to the skill
                check next turn. On gaining the fourth advantage, the
                player is considered the winner. If the player with the

            <para>
                A skill which covers many forms of social skills,
                including oratory, poetry and singing. It may be used to
                rouse a crowd, invent some poetry on the spot, or remember
                a poem or song well enough to recite or sing it.
            </para>

            <para>
                The mood of the audience can be affected with either song,
                poetry or oratory. The performer matches their skill roll
                against the will of the audience. If the audience can be
                treated as a <e>crowd</e>, take the average will and roll
                once for the whole audience (a vocal few will tend to
                lead the silent majority). Success by the performer will
                mean the crowd listens to what the performer says, and
                will think about it, though their opinion isn't shifted
                greatly. For each full 10 the performer beats the will
                of the crowd, the crowd's mood is shifted one category.

            <para>
                When singing or reciting poetry, the mood of the audience
                can be shifted, sometimes considerably. This can be done
                subtly, though it takes an evening of performance to carry
                it out.
            </para>

            <para>
                A more direct way to sway an audience is through oratory.

                Being able to turn useless scrap into something useful. Used
                with intelligence. Covers finding, planning and building,
                though skills such as <e>carpentry</e> or <e>blacksmith</e>
                may be needed as well.

                Blowing things up is easy, but doing it with the minimum
                of explosives, at minimal risk to yourself, and in a way
                that causes maximum damage is somewhat harder. This skill
                provides everything you need to know about destroying
                things with explosives. You also know about the different
                types of explosives, how best to store, move and deploy
                them, and how to disarm other people's bombs.

                Most infantry has experience with digging trenches,
                building bridges and putting up sandbags. A combat
                engineer has a lot of experience doing this. This
                skill covers getting the job done in the minimum
                time, often so that's its good enough to do what it
                needs to do. It covers a wide range of tasks, from
                bridge building to tunnelling, and is more practical
                than theoretical.

            <para>
                Unlike 'real' engineering skills, this one assumes
                that the needed materials aren't readily to hand and
                that the people doing most of the heavy lifting are
                mostly unskilled infantry, so the result will
                often be simple and ugly. But it'll work.

            <title>Damage, Stuns and Wounds</title>

            <para>
                Damage can take many forms, but it all comes down to one
                of the three types - either <e>wounds</e>, <e>stuns</e> or
                <e>mixed</e>. Related to damage is <e>fatigue</e> and
                <e>exhaustion</e>.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Fatigue</title>

                <para>
                    A character's fatigue is measured in a similar way to
                    wounds, though the number of fatigue levels they have
                    is based on their health, ranging from OK to
                    Exhausted. If a character becomes Exhausted then they
                    must immediately rest.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Fatigue is normally short term, and can be lost in
                    minutes. Exhaustion is gained through long term
                    effort or lack of sleep, and can only be lost through
                    a night of sleep. Exhaustion and fatigue stack
                    together on the same track - two levels of
                    fatigue and two levels of exhaustion add up to
                    four levels on the fatigue track, and count as a
                    single penalty as if the character had four levels
                    of either.
                </para>

                <para>
                    It is suggested that fatigue is kept track of on the
                    character sheet by crossing off fatigue levels
                    with a single line, and exhaustion with a cross.
                    Exhaustion is always <e>first</e> on the line,
                    and last to be lost.
                </para>

                <title>Size effects on Damage</title>

                <para>
                    Damage against a creature which is 10 size points
                    or more higher than the attacker have the damage
                    type shifted down by a category (so <e>wounds</e> become
                    <e>mixed</e>, <e>mixed</e> become <e>stuns</e> and
                    <e>stuns</e> become <e>ineffective</e>).
                </para>

                <para>
                    If the target is 15 size points larger, then the damage
                    is shifted down two categories. These effects make
                    larger weapons (spears and great swords for example)
                    more effective against large creatures, since they
                    offset this to some extent.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The converse is also true. If the attacker is 10 size
                    points or more larger than the target, then the damage
                    type is shifted up one category, and up two categories
                    if they are 15 size points higher. There is no damage
                    category above <e>wounds</e>, so such damage is
                    unaffected.
                </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Vehicle Scale Weapons</title>

                <para>
                    The use of <e>Vehicles</e> in <s>Yags</s> is covered
                    more fully in a separate article. Vehicle mounted
                    weapons can, if they hit, be very effective against
                    human targets. Vehicle damage is either <e>Major</e>
                    (similar to wounds) or <e>Minor</e> (similar to stuns).
                    Either type of vehicle damage is treated the same
                    against characters. Unless a character is in Heavy
                    armour, a character gets <e>no</e> soak against
                    vehicle scale weapons.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A character in heavy armour has their total soak roll
                    halved, and always suffers wounds.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Character scale weapons against vehicles have their
                    damage roll halved, and only cause <e>Minor</e> damage.
                    Damage may also be shifted down due to the Size of
                    the target. Character scale weapons shifted down
                    have no effect against large vehicles (there is no
                    <e>ineffective</e> damage against vehicles).
                </para>

                <para>
                    If vehicle damage is shifted up a category against
                    characters, then heavy armour is ignored, but there
                    are otherwise no extra effects.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Most man-portable firearms are considered to be Size 5.
                    Anti-vehicle weapons (such as a tank's main gun) are
                    normally Size 10 regardless of the size of the firing
                    vehicle. Naval guns and artillery are Size 20.

                <sect3>
                    <title>Explosive damage</title>

                    <para>
                        <e>Explosive</e> damage tends to affect all targets
                        within an area, with less damage being caused to
                        targets at the edge than near ground zero. When
                        weapons cause explosive effects, they are listed as
                        <s>Ex-X</s>, where <s>X</s> is the base radius of
                        the explosion in metres.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Out to the base radius, targets receive the full
                        force of the explosion, and suffer <e>wounds</e>.
                        Out to twice the radius, targets receive only
                        mixed damage (but the damage rating is itself
                        unchanged) and out to triple the radius
                        <e>stuns</e> are caused.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        An explosion which does less than <e>wounds</e> will
                        have a similar drop in damage types, but may do no
                        damage at x2 or x3 ranges.
                    </para>

                    <sect4>
                        <title>Very large explosions</title>

                        <para>
                            The above assumes small explosions, normally
                            those designed to be effective against
                            characters. Larger explosions are treated as
                            <e>Vehicle</e> weapons, and hence cause
                            vehicle scale damage. Anything which is the
                            equivalent of a pound or more of TNT is
                            generally considered to be vehicle scale.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            A vehicle scale explosion does <e>Major</e>
                            damage out to the blast radius, and <e>Minor</e>
                            damage out to twice this. For each doubling of
                            the radius beyond this, reduce the damage by
                            100 (explosions causing less than +100 damage
                            will only damage out to twice the radius).
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            One pound (about 0.5kg) of TNT does +50 damage
                            and has an explosive radius of 2 metres. It is
                            considered to be a <t>Size</t> 10 weapon. Every
                            doubling of the TNT amount causes +10 damage,
                            each ten fold increase doubles the radius, and
                            each thousand fold increase raises the
                            <t>Size</t> by +10.

                            So, you've just dropped a 4000lb bomb on someone,
                            and want to know how much damage it does. The
                            simple answer is a lot. In most cases, the result
                            is an instant (messy) death.

                            If they're in a tank, or it's not a direct hit,
                            then it gets a bit more tricky. As a rough guide,
                            assume the following conversion for basic
                            explosives.

                            A single pound of TNT (since pounds is what TNT
                            is normally measured in) does +50 damage Ex-2.
                            Each doubling of the amount of explosive does an
                            extra +10 damage. Each ten fold increase in amount
                            of explosive doubles the radius.

                    Surviving the battle isn't always enough, and many

                    than during it - especially if there is no access to

                        Failure or fumble will cause your wounds to

                        If you have been wounded (but not critically

                        Failure means that the wound will worsen by

                <para>
                    It is generally a good idea to get your wounds tended
                    to by another. Tending a wound takes one minute, and
                    requires an <y:intelligence>First aid</y:intelligence>
                    check at a base target of 10. The target is modified by
                    the total of your <e>wound</e> and <e>stun</e>
                    penalties halved (round up).
                </para>

                <para>
                    For example, you have moderate (-10) wounds and
                    light (-5) stuns, so the first aid difficulty will
                    be 10 + (10 + 5)/2 = 18.
                </para>

                <para>
                    On success, the wounds are stabalised. On a <e>good</e>
                    success, one level of wounds is immediately healed.
                </para>

                <para>
                    <e>Stuns</e> can be first aided as well, except that
                    the base target is 0, with the same modifiers. On
                    success, one stun is healed, and each level of success
                    beyond that heals another stun.
                </para>

                <para>
                    You may first aid yourself, though since you suffer
                    your full penalties whilst trying to do so, it may
                    be much harder than having someone else do it.

                        target of 0, modified by half the total wound and
                        stun penalties currently suffered. Each level of
                        success causes one level of stun to be healed.

                    <para>
                        Wounds heal naturally after a week. Each week, the
                        character gets a health roll at difficulty 20,
                        modified by their total stun and wound penalties.
                        On a success, a single level of wound is healed.

                    <para>
                        If the character fumbles their health roll, then
                        their injury worsens, and they gain an extra wound
                        level. A character who is already fatally wounded
                        will die.

                    <para>
                        If the wounded individual is spending the time
                        resting, and they are being looked after by someone
                        who has the <e>first aid</e> skill (spending at
                        least an hour a day with them), then they receive
                        a bonus equal to the healer's <e>first aid</e>

                    <para>
                        The only way to recover from fatigue is through
                        rest. For each level of fatigue or exhaustion a
                        character has, it takes five minutes to recover
                        one level of fatigue.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Exhaustion counts towards fatigue, but cannot be
                        lost through a few minutes of rest. Four hours of
                        good sleep with remove all fatigue and one point
                        of exhaustion for every two points of health
                        (rounded up, so 2 exhaustion is recovered by
                        someone with a health of 3 or 4).

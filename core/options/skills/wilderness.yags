    <skill name="Animal care" type="wilderness">
        <description>
            <para>
                Experience with animals, and a practical knowledge of their
                general behaviour. It does not provide recognition of
                animals, nor knowledge of specific animals, but a general
                knowledge of how they will behave, and how to gain their
                trust, calm them or otherwise manipulate them.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                It is similar to <e>charm</e>, but for animals. It is used
                with Charisma.

                Being able to use a small oared boat. Based on intelligence
                for judging travel conditions, strength for speed or

    <skill name="Hunting" type="wilderness">
        <description>
            <para>
                The skill of training, caring for and hunting with hounds.
                If trained dogs are available, can be used instead of
                survival to track or hunt game.
            </para>

    </skill>
    
    <skill name="Navigation" type="wilderness">
        <description>
            <para>
                The skill of seafarers the world over, enables a sailor
                to determine where they are, and where they are going.
                As for <e>survival</e>, allows direction and time of
                day to be determined. It also however allows the sailor
                to determine the effects of wind and currents, and
                estimate the sailor's latitude.
            </para>

        <examples>

    <skill name="Ride" type="wilderness">
        <description>
            <para>
                The ability to ride, normally a horse. A different skill
                is needed for different types of animals (horses and ponies
                would be the same skill, a Griffin another skill). As well
                as enabling you to remain mounted, it grants a bonus to
                combat skills when mounted if the relevant techniques
                are known.
            </para>
        </description>
    </skill>

    <skill name="Teamster" type="wilderness">
        <description>
            <para>
                Handling a team of animals, either pack animals or horses or
                oxen pulling wagons. Care, feeding and pacing, as well as
                being able to distribute load across the team to get the
                maximum efficiency.
            </para>
        </description>
    </skill>

    <skill name="Survival" type="wilderness">
        <description>
            <para>
                There is one survival skill for each type of terrain.
                Possible choices include woodland, plains, coastal, desert,
                arctic, mountains, jungle and swamp. If the wrong survival
                skill is being used, then there is a penalty to the skill
                roll, and any circumstance penalties are doubled.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                With it, the character is able to find food
                and shelter, track game, and know how to travel safely
                and quickly through that type of terrain.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                A survival skill in one type of terrain can be used in a
                different type of terrain, though at penalty. Related
                terrains suffer a -10 penalty and fumble on a 1-2. All
                other terrains suffer a -30 penalty and fumble on a 1-5.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                <e>Arctic</e>: Cold, barren lands. Includes land and
                coastal regions. Related to mountains.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                <e>Coastal</e>: Any coastal region that isn't swamp
                or arctic. Can be used at no penalty in woodland, plains,
                desert, jungle or mountain regions as long as the
                character is on the coast.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                <e>Desert</e>: Hot dry plains or hills. Related to
                plains and mountains.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                <e>Jungle</e>: Hot wet jungles. Related to woodland and
                swamp.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                <e>Mountains</e>: Barren rocky lands where animals tend
                to be rare, and grazing is scarce. Related to woodland
                and plains.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                <e>Plains</e>: Non-wooded landscapes, such as steppe or
                praerie (doesn't actually need to be flat, the lack of
                a woodland ecosystem is the important point). Related
                to woodland.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                <e>Swamp</e>: Wetlands. Related to jungle.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                <e>Woodland</e>: Temperate woodland, would include most
                of Europe. Related to plains. 
            </para>
            
            <para>
                Various tasks can be attempted with the survival skill,
                including, but not limited to, the following.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                <e>Foraging</e>: When foraging for food, it takes four hours
                for each roll. Each five over the difficulty allows enough
                food to be found for another two people. If more food is
                found than is needed, then the forager has the option of
                stopping early as soon as enough food has been found. Assume
                that food is found at a consistent rate through the time
                period.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                <e>Hunting</e>: Similar to foraging, it takes four hours
                for each attempt to hunt game. Success indicates that
                suitable game has been found, and relevant combat skills
                are required to actually kill the animal. In this case,
                game is large game animals, such as deer.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                <e>Navigation</e>: Anyone with any survival skill can
                navigate by use of the sun and stars. This is unaffected
                by the terrain type and difficulty of surviving in that
                terrain. When attempting to navigate, use the character's
                highest survival skill.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                <e>Tracking</e>: Survival can be used to track others by
                their footprints and other signs. It is possible to
                estimate the type of animal, their number and how long it
                has been since the tracks were made. Of course, it can be
                used to track people as well.

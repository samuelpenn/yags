    <description>
    The Order of Hyvrik is the Larani clerical order which sponsors
    the fighting order Checkered Shield. The order is very wealthy,
    holding vast estates throughout Kanday.
    <br/>
    Most members of the Order are temple priests, trained in the
    teachings of their goddess, and to some extent in war, so that
    they are at least able to defend themselves and their parish
    from danger.

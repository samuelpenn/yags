                Harn is far from being Magic Weak. Although uncommon,
                accomplished magi with awesome powers do exist.
                Characters with the interest and natural ability to
                practice the hidden arts have the option to enter an
                elite vocation that demands skill and dedication to
                prosper.

                <para>
                    The Guild of Arcane Lore is a loose association of
                    alchemists, astrologers, magi, rune masters etc.
                    The Shek-Pvar is a sub-organisation (actually, six
                    separate organisations) within the guild. Shek-Pvar
                    subscribe to a doctrine called Pvarism. This doctrine
                    perceives and describes Kelestia (everything that
                    exists) in terms of six key elemental principles:
                    Air, Fire, Metal, Earth, Water and Spirit. Because
                    manipulation of these elements imposed unique
                    demands upon the mind and body, six schools of
                    arcane lore evolved, each stressing one of the
                    elements.

            <title>Convocations</title>

            <para>
                A Shek-Pvar first attunes to a Primary convocation and
                learns primary spells. Adjacent to this are the
                secondary convocations and spells. Those two removed
                are tertiary. The convocation opposite the primary is
                the diametric. These relationships are symbolised by the
                Pvaric Wheel.

            <para>
                There is a seventh 'element', which is neutrality.
                Neutrality is represented by the colour grey, and
                corresponds to counter magic, inter world travel
                and energy storage.

            <title>Spells</title>

            <para>
                Knowledge of convocations is merely theoretical. In
                order to apply that knowledge and actually cast a
                spell, the Shek-Pvar must have knowledge of the spell
                in question.
            </para>

            <para>
                It is not possible for a Shek-Pvar to cause a magical
                effect without having learned a spell to perform that
                effect. Spontaneous magical effects are not possible
                according to currently understood theories
                of Pvarism.
            </para>

            <para>
                A Shek-Pvar has a skill with each spell. Learning spells
                is actually quite easy, and it is possible to rapidly
                achieve a useful skill level with a spell.
            </para>

                <title>Casting Spells</title>

                <para>
                    In order to cast a spell, the Shek-Pvar multiplies
                    together their convocation skill and their spell
                    skill. In effect, the convocation is treated as
                    the attribute, and the spell is the skill. If this
                    total matches the level of spell, then the spell is
                    successfully cast.

                    <title>Fatigue</title>

                    <para>
                        Casting a spell can result in fatigue, the amount
                        depending on how well the spell was cast, and the
                        relationship of the spell's convocation to that
                        of the Shek-Pvar.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A spell in a Shek-Pvar's primary convocation can
                        be cast without fatigue if the casting roll is
                        five or more points above the level of the spell.
                        Any roll less than this causes one point of long
                        term fatigue, regardless of whether the spell was
                        cast or not. A diametric spell will always cause
                        at least one level of fatigue. Neutral spells are
                        considered to be equal to secondary spells
                        for the purposes of fatigue.

                        maximum amount of fatigue for that type of spell
                        (so a failure to cast a tertiary or diametric
                        spell causes four levels of fatigue to be lost).

                        A spell casting which results in unconsciousness
                        is still a success, though if the spell requires
                        concentration, then concentration
                        is immediately lost.

                        The spells are listed with three main game
                        attributes - level, range and resist. The level

                        it is to cast. Higher level spells are more
                        powerful however.

                        <para>
                            The level of a spell is a measure of how
                            complicated it is to cast. Spells have
                            seven different complexity ranks, and each
                            rank has a different level associated with
                            it. Many spells can also be boosted beyond
                            their basic level. If the spell is cast at
                            this level (and the level is chosen before
                            the spell is attempted),
                            then extra effects come into play.

                            A level 30 spell requires a difficulty 30
                            spell casting roll to cast it. If it is
                            boosted once, it becomes difficulty
                            30 + 15 = 45. Boosting it twice makes it
                            level 60, and three times makes it level 90.

                            convocations. Once learnt, these spells can be
                            cast as any convocation, using the relevant

                            the Neutral and Peleahn convocations. If
                            summoning a Fire Elemental, she would use her
                            Peleahn convocation. If summoning a Grey
                            Elemental, she would use her Neutral
                            convocation.

                            <em>Summon Elemental</em> spell at its full
                            skill to summon an Iron Elemental, using her

                        <para>
                            Most spells can be cast in a single round. If
                            a casting time is not given for a spell, then
                            assume it can be cast in one round. Such spells
                            occur during the normal initiative phase within
                            combat. The Shek-Pvar uses agility x spell
                            skill, with a penalty of -5 per spell rank for
                            their initiative total.

                            Spells which take more than a round to cast
                            always go off at the end of the round they
                            are cast in. Normally such spells aren't
                            used in combat situations anyway, so it is
                            rarely of much importance.

                                If the Shek-Pvar is distracted while casting
                                a spell, then a will roll may be needed in
                                order to maintain concentration. If damage
                                is sustained, a will check of difficulty
                                10 + 5 x body levels is required. If
                                successful, spell casting may proceed at
                                -5 per wound.

                                a difficulty 30 will check is needed, which
                                allows spell casting to continue at a -15
                                penalty.

                                Exact penalties are left to the GM's
                                discretion, but basically, an 8 hour spell
                                will not suffer from missing the odd few
                                minutes.

                            The duration of a spell is how long it lasts
                            after it has been cast. Most spells are either
                            momentary, or concentration

                                Any spell with this duration lasts as long as
                                the caster continues to concentrate on it.
                                Concentrating on a single spell does not
                                preclude other actions - including casting other
                                spells. It is even possible to concentrate on
                                more than one spell at once, though it does get
                                progressively harder.

                                The first spell gives a -5 penalty to all

                                it is being concentrated on. The second spell
                                gives a further -10 penalty, the third a -15
                                penalty and so on. All penalties are
                                cumulative. Concentrating on three spells gives
                                a total -30 penalty.

                                If the character suffers body levels of damage
                                when concentrating on spells, a will check of
                                difficulty 5 per body level is needed (remember
                                the penalty for concentrating on spells).
                                Failure means that half (round up) the spells
                                are dropped. The Shek-Pvar chooses which spells
                                to drop.

                            <entry term="Ward">
                                Spells with a duration of ward go dormant
                                when they are cast. They can be detected
                                and dispelled while dormant, though will
                                rarely have a visible presence. When a
                                trigger condition is met (this varies from
                                spell to spell), the spell is activated,
                                and its powers come into effect. The actual
                                powers of the spell generally have a
                                duration of momentary, so once the ward has
                                been activated, it terminates.
                                <br/>
                                Only one ward can be placed on an object,
                                location or person at any one time. If a
                                second ward is placed, then it automatically
                                fails. A second ward cannot be placed within
                                an aura of a living creature. It is not
                                possible for a person to carry two items
                                which are both warded. One of the wards
                                (choose randomly) fails if this happens.
                                <br/>
                                There are exceptions however. Some wards can
                                be stacked with themselves. These are rare,
                                and stacking always has other side effects.

                    When a Shek-Pvar is first trained, they are trained
                    in a single convocation. They are attuned to this
                    convocation for the rest of their life, and with
                    the exception of becoming a Grey Mage, they cannot

                    Later, it may be possible to learn a different

                    learned before a corresponding Tertiary convocation.
                    'Learned' in this case means up to a level of at
                    least four. The diametrically opposed convocation

                    (journeyman) will know their primary convocation
                    and the neutral convocation when they enter play.

                    Spells can either be learned or invented. Learning
                    can be from a book, or from a tutor. Inventing
                    spells is a long and difficult process that can
                    take many months, or even years, so most Shek-Pvar
                    prefer learning from the work of others, rather than
                    re-inventing the wheel.

                    Initially written to help mavari in their studies,
                    grimoires have become quite common at all levels of
                    skill. They are basically a collection of tracts on
                    a number of different spells. Study of the grimoire
                    will provide knowledge in each of the spells covered.

                    Like any other book, a grimoire has a level and a

                    for each spell which the reader has a lower score in
                    than the level of the grimoire, they get one study
                    gain roll, at the quality of the grimoire. A study
                    roll is possible even if the student has no skill
                    in the spell.

                    <para>

                Beginning Shek-Pvar PCs are assumed to have come to
                the end of their apprenticeship. They have been
                released from the bond of apprenticeship and sent
                into the world as one of the Satia-Mavari (journeyman).
                They are expected to survive on their wits for at
                least a year and a day. Any time after that, they
                may return with a suitable gift for their chantry.
                Normally, this consists of three items of value, and
                three 'original-arts', meaning spells
                the former master does not know how to cast.

            <para>
                Pvarism is restricted to only affected that which is in sight,
                and even the more powerful magics are restricted in their effects
                at long range. However, the Shek-Pvar do have a way of affecting
                that which would otherwise be beyond their reach, and this is
                through the use of elementals.
            </para>

            <para>
                Each of the convocations has a type of elemental associated with
                it. Elementals are sapient spirits formed from the element of
                their convocation. A common use is to use them as scouts, to spy
                on places a long way away, or to carry messages between Shek-Pvar.
                Elementals range greatly in power, and the individual types will
                be described in the section detailing the relevant convocation.
                However, a brief guide to them is given here.

                <title>Types of Elemental</title>

                <para>
                    The strength and capability of an elemental is measured according
                    to its type. A type I elemental is barely sapient, and has little
                    physical strength. Type VIII elementals are amongst the most powerful
                    normally dealt with. They can be quite intelligent, strong willed,
                    and very powerful physically.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Each type of elemental corresponds to a complexity rank for spells.
                    Most spells to control elementals are multi-level, and also common.
                    This means a different spell is needed to summon an elemental
                    of Peleahn instead of a Lyahvi elemental.

                        A type I elemental is the weakest elemental it is
                        possible to summon. It has a base intelligence and
                        will of one, and is incapable of understanding

                        see if it can see movement, or to carry or fetch

                        Type II elementals have an intelligence of one
                        and a will of two. They can follow conditional
                        commands, such as to give warning if something
                        happens, or to follow a person. They can count
                        and recognise things which are not directly
                        related to themselves.

                        guard and protect someone, to listen on a
                        conversation and report back, or to hunt down

                    <para>
                        An elemental is summoned with the use of the Summon Elemental
                        spell. This is a common spell, and one version of it exists
                        for each convocation.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Summoning an elemental takes one minute. The elemental always
                        appears next to the summoner, and a ego check must be made by
                        both the summoner and the elemental as soon as it arrives, in
                        order to see if the elemental is controlled. If control fails,
                        then the elemental will do as it pleases. Roll a d20, on a
                        1-19, it returns to where it came from. On a 20, it goes on a
                        random rampage, attacking anything in sight.

                    <para>
                        Assuming the elemental is controlled, then it can be given
                        commands. Very simple commands can be given with gestures,
                        however anything more complicated requires the caster to speak
                        and understand a Pvaric language. This can normally be done
                        with the Speak with Elemental spell.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The elemental must normally remain within range of the spell.
                        If the elemental ever leaves the spell range, then another
                        ego check is required to maintain control of the elemental.
                        On failure, control is lost as when the elemental is first
                        summoned. Success, allows the elemental to be controlled, but
                        a further check is required each minute it remains beyond the
                        normal spell range. An out of range elemental will halt and
                        rest, awaiting further instruction.

            <para>
                Minor artifacts are the most common of the magical items
                constructed by Shek-Pvar. They are easy and quick to make,
                though are temporary in nature. They are limited to
                duplicating the effects of a single convocation.

                    Firstly, an item must be found which is suitable to
                    contain the powers of a minor artifact. The following
                    suggestions should be used as a guide when determining

                            magic does not convey any protection to the
                            focus, so weak materials have a down side.

                            Gems and glass is good, as are mirrors,

                    A minor artifact can be used by anyone if the trigger event is
                    physical (such as a word or action). If the trigger event is a
                    mental command, then the user must have attuned to the item first,
                    which more or less restricts the item to Shek-Pvar.

                    When the item is activated, the last spell stored in it is cast
                    at the target designated by the user. If the user has attuned to

                constructed in a couple of days, a major artifact can take several
                months to build.

                A major artifact consists of several components - it requires a
                source of power and a spirit to control it.

                <title>Creating the Artifact</title>
                
                <para>
                    The first stage of artifact creation is to purify a
                    suitable item, by use of the <i>Focus</i> spell. This
                    attunes it to the correct convocation. A Grey Mage may
                    create Grey items, which are capable of using all
                    convocations. Other magi however are limited to creating
                    artifacts of only a single convocation. It does not
                    have to be the primary convocation of the magus.
                </para>
                
                <para>
                    The second stage is to summon and trap a spirit. The
                    False Soul spell does this, crafting an elemental
                    spirit of a particular type. False Soul is always a
                    neutral spell. As for summoning elementals, the rank
                    of the False Soul summons a spirit of equal rank.
                </para>
                
                <para>
                    When the spirit is summoned, it can be given a purpose.
                    Binding a spirit to a single purpose gives it more
                    power, at the expense of limiting what it will be
                    willing to do. A spirit with a purpose also has more
                    intelligence, so is able to act on its own violation.

                    <para>
                        The normal sort of elementals that get summoned won't
                        do when creating a major artifact. False Soul creates
                        a special sort of spirit. It has a convocation score
                        in its element, which is equal to some multiple of
                        its will. The will of a False Soul is equal to its
                        rank.

                    <para>
                        The multiplier depends on the purpose which the soul
                        is given. The more restrictive the purpose, the higher
                        the multiplier, but getting the soul to do anything
                        contrary to its purpose, is difficult at best.

                        Spirits are easier to trap and control if they are
                        willing. A willing spirit can be obtained by giving
                        it a purpose. The narrower the purpose, the more
                        powerful the spirit.

                        item. Multi-level neutral spell. The level of the
                        spell gives the will of the spirit that is created.
                        This will is then reduced to put controls on the
                        spirit.

                        The item needs to be powered somehow by an energy
                        source. This can be internal to the spirit, from
                        the owner, or from the outside world. It can also
                        be within the item itself. This is easy, but
                        limited.

                            An energy pool is internal to the item. It cannot
                            recharge itself, and needs to be recharged by
                            use of the <em>Recharge</em> spell.

                            An energy pool has power equal to 5 x its
                            (rank - 1). An item can have as many energy
                            pools as it has room for. A few large energy
                            pools are more efficient than lots of small ones
                            however.

                            several, the largest is used. Has a daily

                            of spell, or gain one fatigue. If spell matches
                            convocation of both item and user, difficulty

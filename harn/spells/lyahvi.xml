<grimoire convocation="Lyahvi">
<preface>
Lyahvi is the magic of the air, of the insubstantial, the invisible, 
the ethereal, and the illusory. Lyahvian magi are manipulators of 
light: reflection, refraction and confusion, with effects faster than the 
eye and difficult to describe. 
They are masters of air and other gases, of sound (which travels on the air), 
and they can summon Asiri and other ethereals to their benefit. The 
Lyahvi nemesis is earth, represented by the convocation of Fyvria. The 
essence of Lyahvi is bright, sterile and unliving. Secondary: Peleahn, 
Savorya. Tertiary: Jmorvi, Odivshe. Diametric: Fyvria.

<description>
Summons a sapient element of Lyahvi, which appears as a small mote of 
light, about as bright as a candle flame. The elemental has limited 
intelligence, but can follow simple instructions. It cannot pass through 
solid matter, but can travel as much as 25m away from the caster. If it is 
commanded to travel further than this, then control over it will be lost. It 
can see and hear, though cannot understand any speech other than its 
elemental language, and will have difficulty telling mundane creatures 
apart. All communication with the elemental is speech, in the tongue of the 
lyahvian element. Opposed Will rolls must be made when the sprite is 
summoned in order to control it. The sprite will have a will of one.

Causes the air around the target point to glow softly, with as much light as 
a torch.  If the target is an object, then the light will move with that 
object.  Sentients get a will roll to resist the spell if they are made the 
target.  The more powerful incantations of this spell can increase the range 
of the spell, or the brightness.

<description>
This spell creates an illusory image of a ghostly, humanoid 
apparition. It cannot be made to look like a particular person, 
and it is perfectly stationary. It is obviously 'not real', 
being mostly transparent. It is an awareness difficulty of 10 
to notice it as an illusion. The animated version of the illusion 
is merely a repetitive animation - it is set when the spell is 
cast and cannot be changed.

Shapes the appearance of an object up to size 6 in minor ways. The colour, 
exact shape or size can be changed, though the basic structure of the object 
will still be the same. The object can be 50% bigger or smaller (though no
larger than size 6). A glass could become a vase, a dog a cat etc. If the 
object moves, the spell is broken. The change is a visual illusion only - 
touch, smell or sound is not effected.

<description>
Creates a still, purely optical, illusion. In order to spot that it is an 
illusion requires a perception x awareness roll of 25 + 1 / 10m of distance, 
though the fact that it does not move tends to be a give away. The illusion 
can be of any three dimensional object up to size 6. More powerful castings 
of this spell may allow the illusion to be animated. The animation must be a 
simple and repetitive (such as rippling cloak or hair).

<description>
The target of the spell is made translucent and semi-ethereal, though 
this only affects sentient creatures, so no clothing or equipment will be 
affected along with them. The target has difficulty moving. Normal air 
resists as if they were swimming in molasses, and maximum movement is agility 
metres per round. Solid objects, such as walls, can be moved through at about 
a tenth this speed. The target cannot be easily harmed - sword slashes etc 
will be felt as a stinging pain, but actual damage will only be done on a 
natural roll of 20. Affected targets cannot be larger than the wizard.

<description>
This spell creates powerful, vivid and invisible (subliminal) illusions. 
This is an extremely subtle spell used to help the caster in a conversation. 
The spell may be cast immediately prior to, or in the course of a 
conversation. Thereafter, while it is maintained, the caster can give the 
target brief illusion-flashes which tend to act directly on the subconscious. 
If properly used the subliminal effect can be profound. An experienced 
caster can convince almost anyone of anything. But in the hands of a novice, 
it is generally ineffective. It used to enhance the caster's guile, charm 
or trade skill, it adds +15 if a plausible argument is made.

<description>
A spell to find/summon ethereals. It will find the nearest ethereal 
entity, and the caster will have a general idea of its nature and 
strength. A contest of wills can be made to summon a found ethereal, 
and success means it is under the caster's control for the duration. 
If the caster can summon multiple ethereals, then there is a -1 
penalty to will for trying to control each ethereal beyond the first.

<description>
A spell which allows the caster to increase or decrease the windforce 
in his immediate vicinity. The effect is local, so while it could be 
used to drive a single ship the caster is on, and it cannot be used 
to drive an entire fleet. Wind can be increased from still air to a 
gale force wind. It works best outside, where there is plenty of air 
available. Effects indoors are unpredictable.

<boost>+50 Immune to physical harm</boost>
<boost>+100 Can create a link item</boost>
<description>
Renders the caster translucent and ethereal. In this form he is 
immune to physical damage, but remains susceptible to enchantment. 
With the basic spell, the caster cannot achieve full etherealness. 
He can still feel events in the material world, but cannot affect 
them. He is not immune to physical harm, but injuries are always 
fatigue rather than body levels. Clothes and items carried can 
be affected by the spell, at the caster's option. 
If the caster can create a link item, then this is designated on 
casting and must be being touched. It remains physical, but can 
be affected by the caster. If it is taken from him, it can be 
used to harm him.

<description>
An enchantment to protect an object or person against harm by 
dematerialising it. The object evaporates within a round, and 
recombines between a day and a week later, at a point designated 
at the time of casting. Time of recombination is random, and the 
place must have been visited by the caster previously. Accuracy 
drops greatly with distance, though it is generally 'safe'. 
While dematerialised, the subject has no consciousness, and all 
enchantments on them are dropped.

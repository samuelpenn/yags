	<description>
		Allows adherents of the same deity to voluntarily transfer
		luck from themselves to the shaman. The luck can be used
		to replace luck which has been spent temporarily, and
		cannot take the shaman to above their normal limit. If
		the luck is not used by the time the shaman next prays to
		their god, then it is lost.
		<br/>
		One point of luck may be taken from all those who touch
		the shaman at the time the invocation is invoked.

    This ritual is used to prepare the body of a sapient ready for a
    cannibal feast. With it, a part of the body's soul is shared out
    to those who partake in the feast, granting them the skill of the
    consumed person. Each person gets to make a single roll to improve
    a skill, as per the training rules, at a quality of two. A skill
    cannot be improved if the consumed did not have a better skill than
    the eater.
    <br>
    The body must be fresh, since the level of skills available will
    deteriate quite quickly over time.

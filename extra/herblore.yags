            <para>
                Herbs, medicines, poisons and drugs all have similar
                properties, and often how they are classified depends as
                much on why they are used, as it does on their effects.
                The term <e>Herb</e> will be used as a general catch-all
                term for all of the above.
            </para>

            <para>
                This article describes rules for using herbs within the Yags
                system, explaining their effects, and possible uses. These
                rules assume a fantasy or otherwise low-tech background, but
                can be applied to modern or futuristic nerve toxins just as
                well as a witch's brew.
            </para>

            <para>
                These rules assume non-magical properties for herbs. Magical
                herbs would work in a similar way, though their effects
                would not be limited to those outlined here.

            <para>
                Often, herbs will be bought or obtained from someone
                who has already prepared it. Some characters will want
                to find and prepare herbs of their own however, and in this
                case they will need the skills to do so.

            <title>Herb Effects</title>

            <para>
                Herbs and poisons can have a variety of effects when
                administered to a person. Often, a herb will have multiple
                effects, with lesser symptoms occurring first, and more
                serious ones later. For example, a poison might cause
                weakness, followed by paralysis, coma and finally death.
            </para>

            <para>
                These symptoms occur over a period of time which may
                span anything from a few seconds, to several days.
                True <e>instant death</e> poisons are very rare, though
                several may kill a person in less than a minute.
            </para>

            <para>
                Having said that, many poisons and drugs, if properly
                administered, are difficult to resist (modern medicine
                wouldn't be quite as useful as it is, if the effect
                of drugs were quite as random as they often are in role
                playing games). Often, the only chance of survival will
                lay in an antidote, assuming one is readily available.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Standard Effects</title>

                <para>
                    All effects last as least as long as the herb lasts.

                            The herb cleans a wound, preventing it from

                            fall asleep. Penalties from fatigue are halved,
                            and there is a +1 bonus to stamina to all rolls
                            to resist fatigue.

                    <para>
                        Detrimental effects may be either temporary or
                        permanent (though death is always permanent). The
                        description of the herb will say how long the
                        effects last, but they always last as least as
                        long as they are being resisted.

                            rolls. If reduced to zero, then the creature is
                            totally blind. Other skills which rely on sight
                            (such as combat) have their attribute reduced by
                            one as well.

                            time, then there is a further -1 each time, to a
                            minimum of zero (when the creature is probably
                            incapable of moving).

                            symptom is nearly always followed by death. If
                            death does not occur (due to the fatal effects
                            of the poison being resisted), then a stamina
                            roll of 30+ each week can be made to gain
                            consciousness.

                            Creature suffers muscle cramp. This causes a
                            great deal of pain, and makes movement difficult
                            and undesirable. Agility and dexterity are at -1
                            if anything is attempted, and movement is halved.

                            while severe cramps are being suffered, and
                            movement is quartered.

                    Herbs have a number of properties which define how they
                    can be used. Amongst these are potency (how large a dose

                        The toxicity of a herb gives the size of dosage required
                        for the listed effect. Increasing the dosage can give a
                        stronger effect, and/or have undesired side effects.

                    <para>
                        Toxicity is measured on a scale between I and VI. Herbs
                        of toxicity I are not very effective, and require large
                        amounts of the drug to have the desired effect. Such
                        herbs will generally not be listed, since more powerful
                        herbs are normally available, and are much more effective.

                    <para>
                        Strength is often linked to potency. If the listed dose
                        is given, then the strength of the herb is compared to
                        the subject's stamina to see if the listed effects occur.
                        A larger dose, or better preperation of the herb, can
                        result in a higher than listed strength.

                    <para>
                        The time for a herb to have its effects. Fast herbs act
                        in rounds, slow herbs act in hours or longer. Most herbs
                        have a time of minutes.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The time given must pass before the herb has its first
                        effect, at which point a stamina check is made against
                        the strength of the herb. Another check is required after
                        each passage of 'time'.

                    <para>
                        A modifier to the herb strength is given here as well,
                        which reduces the strength of the herb by the given
                        amount after each stamina check.

                        One or more effects will be listed for each herb.
                        The first effect comes into play as soon as a
                        stamina roll is failed. If multiple effects are
                        listed, then the next effect along kicks in when
                        the next stamina check is failed.

                    <para>
                        Many herbs have several applications, allowing them
                        to be tailored to fit the occasion. At one dosage, a
                        herb may heal, at another, it may kill. Similarly,
                        different dosages may allow a poison to have a slow
                        effect over time, making it harder to detect and
                        counter.

                        remain in the system can be administered in this
                        way.

                <title>Example of Herb Use</title>

                <para>
                    A poison has a strength of 30, a time of 1 minute/-5,
                    and effects of weakness, cramps, paralysis, coma, death.
                    Some unsuspecting person, with a stamina of 3, drinks
                    some of this poison. A minute later, she must make a
                    stamina roll to resist, against the poison's strength
                    of 30. She rolls 12 + 14 = 26, and the poison 'rolls'
                    30 + 7 = 37. She starts to feel weak, and possibly
                    guesses that something is wrong.
                </para>

                <para>
                    After two minutes, she makes a second check, rolling a
                    total of 23. This time the poison's strength is down to
                    25, plus a die roll of 10, means the victim is suffering
                    the second effect - cramps.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A minute later, the strength of the poison has reduced
                    to 20. Again her roll is not enough to resist the poison,
                    so she becomes paralysed.
                </para>

                <para>
                    After four minutes, the poison's strength is down to
                    15. She rolls a total of 28, against the poison's 22.
                    This time, she resists. She remains paralysed, but
                    does not slip into a coma.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Another minute, and the poison is weakening, now down
                    to a strength of 10. However, the victim's stamina
                    roll is not good, and she slips into a coma.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Six minutes after she took the poison, she makes another
                    roll to resist the poison, now strength 5. She makes it,
                    staving off death. The poison's strength is then reduced
                    to zero, and it can have no more effect. The victim is
                    not dead, but she will probably remain in a coma for a
                    long while.

            <para>
                <tm>YAGS is Another Game System</tm>, one that is meant to
                provide a free, generic and modular set of rules for table
                top roleplaying. YAGS is designed to provide a realistic,
                but also cinematic, set of rules that allow fast play without
                compromising on detail when it's needed.
            </para>

            <para>
                <tm>YAGS</tm> has a flexible skill based system for determining
                how competent characters are. There are no levels or classes,
                and skills cover a wide (technically unlimited) range to
                allow character growth over a long campaign.

                    These <s>Core</s> rules are meant for game masters
                    or game designers who want a low level view of the
                    rules for YAGS. It is completely setting and genre
                    agnostic, not meant as an introduction to the game.
                </para>

                <para>
                    It is recommended that first time readers start with
                    one of the <s>Characters</s> articles, which will
                    provide an introduction to the game as well as provide
                    rules for character generation.

            <para>
                <tm>YAGS</tm> is split into a number of articles, of which
                this - <e>Core</e> - provides a description of the core rules
                unfettered by setting or genre concerns. There are no character
                generation rules provided here, since these are considered to
                be setting specific.

                The articles are colour coded according to their nature.

                <item name="Core Rules (orange)">
                    Basic rules, from simple task resolution to expanded
                    coverage of skills and environments. Most will be

                This then, is the <e>Core Rules</e>, on which
                everything else is based. However, you don't need to read
                this first - if you just want to generate a character,
                then start with <e>Characters</e>, which gives a quick
                overview of the basics before showing you how to create a
                new character.

                    <tm>YAGS</tm> is designed to be flexible and generic,

                    just by how the rules work. <tm>YAGS</tm> is designed to
                    be fairly realistic, encouraging a low fantasy, gritty
                    style of game with a deadly combat system.

                <tm>YAGS</tm> has a relatively simple set of basic rules
                which form the core of the rest of the system. This article
                provides a detailed description of these core rules for
                those interested in the basic mechanics or GMs
                wanting to extend <tm>YAGS</tm>. For character generation,

                <para>
                    The following terminology is used throughout the
                    <s>YAGS</s> rules. Where these terms are used, the
                    specific definitions given here are what is meant.

                    <item name="Attribute">
                        One of the eight basic numbers which define any
                        creature in YAGS. A typical adult human has a
                        score of 3 in all their attributes.

                    <item name="Skill">
                        A skill defines a creature's training and
                        experience in a narrow field. Skills are combined
                        with attributes to determine a creature's ability
                        at a task. A professional level is skill is 4+.

                        A creature's ability to achieve success in a task
                        is equal to an attribute multiplied by a skill, or
                        an attribute multiplied by 4 for a raw attribute check.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Score">
                        The raw numerical value of any characteristic,
                        unmodified by anything else. A skill score would
                        be a creature's rating in a skill, before it is

                        An activity that requires an ability check. To make

                        exceed the difficulty of the task to succeed. A
                        moderate (average) task has a difficulty of 20.

                <title>Task Resolution</title>

                <para>
                    Task resolution is often at the heart of any game system.
                    In the case of <tm>YAGS</tm>, there is a single mechanic
                    which applies to all tasks which is based on an
                    <e>ability check</e>. This check is used to determine not
                    only whether you succeed, but also how well you succeed.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The GM should determine the most suitable <e>attribute</e>
                    and <e>skill</e> combination to use, and set a target
                    level for the task. <e>Very easy</e> tasks have a target
                    of 10, <e>moderate</e> tasks have a target of 20 and
                    <e>difficult</e> tasks have a target of 30. In some cases
                    you may need to make a check just against an attribute
                    (for example, a <e>Health</e> check to remain conscious)
                    where no skill is involved.
                </para>

                <para flag="green">
                    To make a skill check, you roll <s>Attribute</s> x
                    <s>Skill</s> + 1d20, and if it equals or exceeds the
                    target difficulty then you succeed.
                </para>

                <para flag="green">
                    To make a pure attribute check, then you roll
                    <s>Attribute</s> x 4 + 1d20, and if it equals or exceeds
                    the target difficulty then you succeed.

                <para flag="red">
                    If the d20 rolls a natural '1', then you automatically
                    fail. This is the 'fumble chance', and is normally 1.
                    In some situations, the fumble chance will be higher.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If it is important how well you succeed, then every 10
                    points by which you beat the target is considered an
                    extra level of success. Simply beating the target is
                    considered a <e>moderate</e> success, beating it by
                    10 or more is a <e>good</e> success (2 levels), by 20
                    or more is <e>excellent</e> and 30+ is <e>superb</e>.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Sometimes, a skill contest is called for between two or
                    more characters. In this case, instead of trying to beat
                    a set target number, you try to beat your opponent's
                    ability check.

                <para flag="green">
                    If you are competing against another character, then
                    you both make an ability check, and the highest roll
                    wins. On a tie, the person with the highest skill
                    score wins.

                    In a skill contest, if one of you rolls a natural '20'

                        chance of a fumble, but also means that the task
                        has to be well within your capability.

            <para>
                As with many game systems, <tm>YAGS</tm> measures the ability
                of a character in the game using numerical statistics, called
                <e>attributes</e> and <e>skills</e>. These numbers don't relate
                directly to anything in the real world - they
                are simply a convenient way to compare one character to another.

            <para>
                Since <tm>YAGS</tm> is a game about human comparable characters,
                the statistics are designed to be easy to use when describing
                such characters. It is not so simple if used to compare the
                very small (rodents and insects), or the very large (giant
                mecha or world ships). These things aren't outside the scope of
                the game, but their involvement requires some special rules.
                For the former, see the <e>Bestiary</e>, for the latter see

                <para>
                    Attributes are the basic characteristics of all creatures
                    in <tm>YAGS</tm>, and are a broad measure of natural talent
                    and potential. There are eight primary attributes -
                    strength, health, agility, dexterity, perception,
                    intelligence, empathy and will - and two secondary
                    attributes - size and move.
                </para>

                <para>
                    These attributes are consistent across all settings and
                    genres, and always work in the same way, though the distribution
                    of values may vary. A fantasy setting with a rigid caste
                    system will have few examples of high attributes simply
                    because of the small numbers of people, the lack of
                    formalised training and inability for gifted people to
                    take up a role befitting their ability. A science fiction
                    setting with a population in the trillions, where people
                    are free to take the job they are best suited for, will
                    have more examples of gifted individuals which the PCs
                    will meet.

                    <para>
                        For humans, attributes tend to range between two
                        and five. Higher values are possible, but rare.
                        The following chart describes the different levels
                        from the point of view of an adult human.
                        Non-human creatures may work on different scales,
                        especially for strength which tends to be much
                        higher for large animals.

                        Non-humans will of course have different averages and

                        Attributes are normally purchased during character
                        generation with a point buy system. See the

                        Whether an attribute can be increased after character
                        generation depends on both the setting and campaign
                        style. Since <tm>YAGS</tm> tends to encourage a more
                        realistic view to advancement, attributes can take
                        years of in-game time to increase. Again, see a
                        relevant <s>Character</s> article for your setting.

                            break and lift things. Some effects, such as how much
                            you can carry, are based on the square of your
                            strength.

                            melee or missile weapons. Athletes, cat
                            burglars and martial artists require a good

                            and sensory ability. High perception characters
                            have good senses (vision, hearing) and
                            observational ability. Use of rifles and bows

                            know and remember things, to study and for logic.
                            Sages, researchers and scientists will use

                            not necessarily make you charismatic,
                            but a charismatic person will need a high

                    The most powerful drive in the ascent of man is his pleasure
                    in his own skill. He loves to do what he does well and, having
                    done it well, he loves to do it better.

                    A skill is something which can be learnt and improved
                    through experience and training. Except for a few basic
                    skills, they always default to zero unless specifically
                    learnt. If a skill is zero, then it either can't be used
                    (in the case of many knowledge or science skills), can
                    default to another skill, or is rolled as a straight d20
                    halved (round down).

                    In some settings, it may be possible to learn skills
                    almost immediately, through cyborg implants or because
                    the world is some sort of simulation. It is highly
                    suggested that skills above four are very difficult
                    to obtain in such a way.

                        Once a skill is learnt, it's level ranges from one
                        upwards. There is no theoretical limit to how high
                        your skill can be, though a practical limit is in the
                        range of 10-15. Skills higher than 15 are considered
                        to be <e>mythical</e> - in the realm of supernatural

                        When making an ability check, there are some common
                        difficulty levels, which are described in the
                        following table. The descriptions assume an average
                        level of attribute - those with an above average
                        attribute will be able to get by with less skill.

                        Most tasks will be against a fixed target number. If
                        you are competing against another character, then
                        they get a skill check with a modifier. The modifier
                        is given in parenthesis below, and adds to the
                        other person's check.

                        Sometimes a task is more suited to being resolved
                        with multiple skill checks. This is especially true
                        for challenges which are time critical, or which

                    <para>
                        Such tasks have a difficulty as normal, but require
                        a number of successes to be achieved before the task
                        is complete. For example, disabling a complex trap
                        may be difficulty 20/3, requiring 3 successes over
                        a base difficulty of 20. It's possible to achieve
                        success with a single roll of 40+. It may require
                        three rolls however.

                        If a check fails, then no successes are gained towards

                        increases by +1. Two failures in a row result in
                        complete failure, the results of which are task
                        dependant. A fumble counts as a normal failure, and
                        so increases the fumble chance.

                        standard competitive tasks are used. Each turn, one
                        person from each team is chosen to make the skill
                        test. Each time a person does so, they take a point
                        of fatigue. This prevents one person completely
                        dominating the game and forces each team to share
                        the work.

                        book. You are not so much competing against some

                        A target of 10+ is something bearable, 20+ is something
                        quite decent. Make a single roll for something short,
                        two for something of medium length, and three or more
                        for longer pieces of work. The overall quality is the
                        lowest roll. A full symphony or ballet performance might
                        be five rolls.

                        You may re-roll a single check more than once, and take
                        the best roll each time.

                <para>
                    A <e>Technique</e> is a specialisation of a skill,
                    and may provide bonuses or allow some particular
                    special action to be attempted. A skill may have
                    several techniques associated with it, and some
                    techniques can be used with more than one skill.
                    In the latter case, the technique only needs to
                    be purchased once - it can then be used with any
                    skill which uses it, as long as the skill is of
                    sufficient level.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A technique has a cost associated with it, which is
                    the number of experience points which need to be
                    spent to buy it. A level 6 technique costs 6 points
                    to buy. The cost of the technique is also the
                    minimum skill level that must be achieved before
                    the technique can be purchased. If you do not have
                    the required skill at a sufficient level, then the
                    technique can't be bought.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Finally, a technique may have a prerequisite. These
                    are the techniques which must be known before this
                    technique can be learnt.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Some techniques will be based on a skill group
                    rather than a skill. In this case the technique
                    can be purchased when <e>any</e> skill in that
                    group reaches the technique's level, but it can
                    only be used with those skills of sufficient
                    level.

                    <para>
                        Familiarities, Specialisations and Masteries add
                        a layer of complexity to the system but avoids
                        having to need multiple different skills for
                        similar tasks. It would be possible to simply
                        have a <e>History</e> skill, or a <e>Science</e>
                        skill, and ignore specialisations altogether.

                    <para>
                        However, this was viewed as being too unrealistic
                        for the game. Specialisations which allow you to buy
                        a default skill which covers all topic areas,
                        and then just a few points in individual study
                        areas seemed like a suitable compromise.

                    <para>
                        Some skills require <e>Familiarities</e>,
                        which are techniques of a fixed cost for that
                        skill. Such a skill always has a default
                        familiarity, but will list other familiarities
                        which can be purchased.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        For example, <e>Driving</e> assumes skill at
                        driving a typical car, but has familiarities
                        for <e>Motorbikes</e>, <e>HGVs</e>, <e>Tanks</e>,
                        <e>Buggies</e> and the like. If you don't have
                        the right familiarity, then you have to default
                        to the standard skill and your rolls are halved.

                    <para>
                        Most familiarities will be 2 points, though for

                    <para>
                        Many knowledge skills allow <e>Specialisations</e>.
                        Normally, the difficulty of a knowledge task is
                        based on how specialised a bit of knowledge
                        is. Knowing when the <e>Civil War</e> started is
                        a specific bit of knowledge from late English
                        history, so might be difficulty 30.

                    <para>
                        If you were specialised in <e>English History</e>
                        or <e>Military History</e>, or <e>17th Century</e>
                        then it becomes easier, maybe difficulty 20. For a
                        specialisation in <e>The English Civil War</e>,
                        such a piece of knowledge is obvious.

                    <para>
                        Different specialisations will tend to focus the
                        knowledge you do know. Whilst a success with a
                        <e>English History</e> specialisation will tell
                        you about the politics of the war, and what
                        happened to Oliver Cromwell after the war, a
                        <e>Military History</e> specialisation will
                        give you more information about the battles
                        fought.

                        There is no limit to how many specialisations you

                        can be.

                    <title>Masteries</title>

                    <para>
                        Masteries are levelled specialisations, and are
                        often used for competitive or artistic skills.
                        For tasks which have an artistic component,
                        they allow you to perform feats with grace, precision
                        and perfection. For competitive actions, they provide
                        specialist training to increasing levels of details.
                        For example, <e>Ballet</e> and
                        <e>Gymnastics</e> are masteries based on
                        <e>Athletics</e>. For <e>Games</e>, masteries can
                        include <e>Chess</e>, <e>Go</e> or <e>Backgammon</e>.

                    <para>
                        A <e>Mastery</e> has a base cost of 1 point, but can
                        be bought up to any level as per the normal limits for
                        techniques. If you buy a Mastery at level 1, buying it
                        at level 2 costs one extra point - you don't need to
                        buy a whole new technique.

                    <para>
                        Each level of mastery gives you a +1 bonus when
                        attempting tasks related to it.

                    <para>
                        In a competitive skill check where two characters are
                        directly competing against each other (e.g., in a game
                        of chess, but not in an art contest), if one person has a
                        lower mastery level than the other, then they suffer
                        a +1 to their fumble chance per level of difference.
                        If they have no mastery levels, then the penalty is
                        +2 per level of difference. This represents the master's
                        ability to force their opponent into bad decisions, or
                        take better advantage of the slightest mistake.

                    How large a creature is can be measured in a number of
                    ways - height, length and mass being the common criteria.
                    In <tm>YAGS</tm>, the <t>Size</t> attribute is a measure
                    of the creature's capacity to absorb damage, and how easy
                    it is to hit. In general, the <t>Size</t> of a creature
                    will increase logarithmically with its mass - every +5
                    increase in <t>Size</t> represents a ten fold increase
                    in mass.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Adult humans range in <t>Size</t> from 4 (a small, slim
                    woman) to 6 (a heavyweight boxer or stereotypical Norse
                    warrior). Anything other than the default of 5 represents
                    the extreme edge of human variation. The biggest effect
                    it has is to provide a little bit more (or less) capacity
                    to resist damage. The default character generation rules
                    also put upper and lower limits on <t>Strength</t> for
                    noticeably large or small characters.

                    Each point of <t>Size</t> allows a creature (including PCs)
                    to take one wound before dying. A warhorse can take about
                    twice as much damage as a man, an elephant about 3 times.
                    The details are a bit more complex (small weapons have less
                    effect on large targets) however, and a full description of
                    how wounds and damage works is left for the <s>Combat</s>

                <para>
                    <e>Vehicles</e> and other constructs are actually treated a
                    little differently from creatures, in that their <t>Size</t>
                    is actually based on the volume of the vehicle, rather than
                    its mass. Obtaining real-world figures for the mass of animals
                    is quite simple, but volumes are rarely given. Finding the
                    volume of a vehicle or building is relatively straightforward,
                    but finding a sensible value for its mass can be hard
                    (especially when a vehicle's mass can change drastically
                    depending on whether it is empty or loaded). However, creatures
                    and vehicles should approximate to the same <t>Size</t> for any
                    given size. A <t>Size</t> 5 vehicle is assumed to be one cubic
                    metre, again increasing by a factor of 10 for each +5.

                    The ability to absorb damage is also slightly different for
                    vehicles, in that weapons designed to harm people are far
                    less effective against vehicles, but again this is described

                    How far and fast you (or any creature in <s>YAGS</s>) can
                    move depends on your attributes, skill and how much you
                    are carrying. There are two types of movement - combat
                    movement which covers short distances over a period of
                    a few seconds, and overland movement which covers walking,
                    hiking or running for minutes or hours at a time.

                        combat without any penalty. For an average person, this
                        is 6m/round. This is normally considered a free action.

                            This is effectively a light jog, and can be kept up
                            over long distance. Moving this far in combat
                            counts as an action, and restricts what else the
                            character can do - see the combat article for full
                            details.

                            If running for a long time, the character will gain

                            minutes. A character with a <t>health</t> of 3 and an

                            <e>Exhausted</e>, then any form of movement is considered
                            a full action (you cannot attack, defend or do anything
                            else that round) and you cannot run or sprint.

                            and an athletics score of 2, this would be
                            26m/round. Basically, a person could run the 100m

                        Each level of encumbrance gives a character a -5
                        penalty to all rolls to resist fatigue. A character
                        always has a minimum move of 1, until they become
                        over encumbered. Agility and dexterity can never
                        be reduced below zero. If reduced to zero, then a
                        character can still make agility and dexterity
                        checks, just at zero ability.

            <title>Core Skills</title>

            <para>
                There are eight core skills in <tm>YAGS</tm>, which are
                called <e>Talents</e>. These are known by virtually all
                characters (at least, human ones), since they represent
                basic ability. These skills are described in the general
                skill lists, but what follows is a very detailed look
                at how these skills can be used.
            </para>

            <para>
                It should be noted that the following is rules heavy, and
                in some cases may be best use as guidelines rather than
                hard and fast rules (even more so than normal). A lot of
                what is described are core activities - such as running,
                fast talking, spotting things and the like.
            </para>

            <para>
                When looking at skill difficulties, it should be remembered
                that for these skills, the majority of people will have an
                ability of 6 (3 x 2) - an average roll of 17. A skill check
                of <e>moderate</e> difficulty will be failed 65% of the
                time.

                    Racing down an ally, leaping from roof top to roof top,
                    climbing rapidly up walls or swinging across chasms on
                    ropes - these are all tasks for which the <e>Athletics</e>
                    skill is vital. It covers a wide range of athletic,
                    acrobatic and gymnastic feats, including running,
                    swimming, jumping and climbing. It can provide bonuses
                    in combat, but only if you specialise in certain acrobatic

                    <para>
                        Generally, if you want to run then you don't need to
                        make a skill check. However, sometimes life has a
                        habit of throwing obstacles in your path which can end
                        up testing your skill to the limit. How fast you can
                        run is based on your <t>Move</t> score, and is

                        Racing across clear terrain with nothing in your way
                        is considered trivial, and you don't need to make a
                        skill check to succeed. On the other hand, trying to
                        dodge through crowds of people on a broken and icy
                        footpath can require a lot of skill and luck. If the
                        path is not clear and easy, then an

                        each round. The difficulty is modified by how fast
                        you are moving - halved if moving carefully, doubled

                            slower, but reduces the number of rolls and hence
                            the chance of fumbling.

                    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                </para>

                <para>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                    rights.

                <para>
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                    distribute and/or modify the software.

                <para>
                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                    authors' reputations.

                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

                    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

                <para>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                    along with the Program.

                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

                <para>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

                <para>
                        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                </para>

                <para>
                        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                        parties under the terms of this License.
                </para>

                <para>
                        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                </para>

                <para>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Program.

                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.

                <para>
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

                <para>
                        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
                </para>

                <para>
                        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                        customarily used for software interchange; or,
                </para>

                <para>
                        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                        received the program in object code or executable form with such
                        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                </para>

                <para>
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                    itself accompanies the executable.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                </para>

                <para>
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                    parties remain in full compliance.
                </para>

                <para>
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Program or works based on it.
                </para>

                <para>
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                    this License.
                </para>

                <para>
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgement or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

                <para>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                    circumstances.

                <para>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.

                <para>
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

                <para>
                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                    address new problems or concerns.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                    Foundation.
                </para>

                <para>
                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes

                    Jenny grew up as an orphan in London during the Great War,
                    living as a petty thief. As men started to take an interest
                    in her, she found that prostitution was more profitable.
                    Eventually, she discovered that even more money was to be had
                    by conning and blackmailing men than sleeping with them.

                    She has learnt how to defend herself with both the gun and a
                    knife, but much prefers the former. She risks losing everything
                    however due to a serious drink problem.

                    Joe started his career working on the docks, where he
                    earned extra pay ensuring that certain crates got between
                    ships and shore without the authorities seeing them.
                    When there was trouble, he wasn't averse to using violence
                    to get things quietened down.

                    Strings were pulled, and he now has a job as a customs
                    inspector. He happily accepts bribes from various gangs
                    and ensures that their cargo gets through without trouble.

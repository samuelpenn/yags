                    Born in 1905, Jacqueline's father was killed during the
                    Great War, and her mother died of flue shortly afterwards.
                    She spent her family inheritance in moving to Egypt, where
                    she was able to take up her passions of Egyptian history and
                    exploration.

                    Lord Goodman counted himself as being one of the British
                    Gentry. He inherited his family estates at the turn of
                    the century, and fought in the War that soon followed.
                    Though wounded, he survived, and decided that he wanted
                    to see more of the world.

                <para>
                    Ten years ago he moved permanently to Egypt, where he has
                    many friends and acquaintances amongst the British in
                    the Middle East. He has taught himself history and
                    Egyptology, and spends his time and money digging up
                    random places and plundering their treasures.

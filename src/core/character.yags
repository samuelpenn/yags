            <title>Yet Another Game System?</title>

            <para>
                <tm>YAGS</tm> is a tabletop roleplaying game designed for
                playing games in a wide variety of different genres, including
                fantasy, horror, modern and science fiction. Instead of
                presenting a single rulebook that tries to cater for all
                types of games, it is designed to be flexible and modular,
                using a core set of rules with pluggable components.
            </para>

            <para>
                For the full set of available rules, see the main YAGS website
                at <url>http://yags.glendale.org.uk/</url> where everything is free to
                download.

                What you are reading now is <s>Characters</s>, which provides
                the default character generation rules for modern settings.
                Within these pages, you will find guidelines for designing
                any character from the early 1900s up to the early 21st
                century.

            <para>
                <e>Characters</e> provides everything players need to generate
                characters, including an explanation of the basic rules and a
                generic framework for groups to use in their own campaigns,
                whether they are playing a combat heavy special forces campaign,
                modern horror, a Cold War era spy game or 1920s adventure
                fiction.

                So what sort of games is YAGS?

                YAGS is a generic system that is designed to be flexible and
                extensible. The default setting is the real world, so any
                campaign similar to the real world should fit well.

            <para flag="green">
                YAGS aims for <e>Cinematic Realism</e>. Heroes need to be
                clever to avoid a short life expectancy. Getting shot is
                just as likely to kill them as anyone else, they just need
                to make sure that they shoot first.
            </para>

            <para flag="green">
                YAGS tries for a simple and consistent set of rules, but not
                <e>too</e> simple. Rules can add flavour to a game, and give
                players more options on how to describe and play their
                characters.
            </para>

            <para>
                In YAGS, it is expected that characters can get hurt, or
                even die. It is not assumed that they will succeed just because
                they are the good guys, or because they are doing the heroic
                thing. Of course, it can be run any way the GM sees fit,
                but gritty fiction is the way in which it has been designed.

            <para>
                It is up to the <e>Game Master</e> to decide on the type
                of campaign that will be played by selecting one of
                four starting character levels: <e>Mundane</e>,
                <e>Skilled</e>, <e>Exceptional</e> or <e>Heroic</e>.
                These determine the number of points a player has to
                build their character and the maximum levels they can
                start with on their attributes and skills.
            </para>

            <para>
                This choice does not limit how powerful and/or skilled
                characters can become over time, they merely represent
                how good characters are at the start of the game.
            </para>

            <note title="Cinematic Realism">
                <para>
                    The core rules of YAGS try to portray a model
                    of the world that gives results that are similar to
                    what we might expect in the real world, allowing
                    players and GMs to second guess the results of actions
                    based on their own common sense. This does mean that
                    getting shot is bad, and being outnumbered in a melee
                    is not a good thing. Most characters will be forced
                    into being very careful if they are going up against
                    organised enemies.
                </para>

                <para>
                    However, highly skilled characters can sidestep some
                    of these difficulties, and act more like Hollywood
                    action heroes - awesome, but not completely super
                    human. You can't dodge a bullet, but you might be
                    able to dodge the gun.

            <para>
                <tm>YAGS</tm> aims for something close to realism, whilst
                still allowing for heroic characters. Even the greatest
                hero can be taken out by a single bullet or thrust of a
                sword, but they win against the enemy hordes through
                clever tactics, high skill and possibly some luck.

                <title>The Rules in Brief</title>

                <para>
                    <tm>YAGS</tm> uses a single d20 for all die rolls. When
                    making a skill check, you determine which attribute and
                    skill to use, and roll <s>Attribute</s> x <s>Skill</s>
                    + 1d20. Most professionals will have an attribute of 3
                    and a skill of 4, so will be rolling 12 + 1d20.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A very easy task has a target difficulty of 10, a
                    moderate task 20, a difficult task 30+. You must roll
                    the target difficulty or higher in order to succeed, and
                    the more you roll above the target, the better your
                    success. In some circumstances, difficulties can get as
                    high as 100 or more, though this will be unusual.
                </para>

                <para>
                    In some cases you may need to make a check just against
                    an attribute by itself (for example, a <e>Health</e> check
                    to remain conscious) where no skill is involved. In this
                    case, you roll <s>Attribute</s> x <s>4</s> + 1d20.
                </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Attributes</title>

                    <para>
                        There are eight primary <e>attributes</e> that all
                        characters have, and these define your raw talent.
                        Raising attributes after character generation may
                        be difficult or impossible, depending on the
                        campaign, and though a high attribute won't make
                        you automatically good, it is necessary in order
                        to be very good.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The attributes are <t>Strength</t>, <t>Health</t>,
                        <t>Agility</t>, <t>Dexterity</t>, <t>Perception</t>,
                        <t>Intelligence</t>, <t>Empathy</t> and <t>Will</t>.
                    </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Skills</title>

                    <para>
                        Skills are abilities which are gained through study,
                        experience and training. There are 8 basic skills
                        (talents) which all being at a score of 2, all other
                        skills are assumed to start at zero unless stated
                        otherwise for your background.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A skill of 4 is considered to be a trained
                        professional, 6 is an expert, 8 is elite and 12+
                        is a true master of the profession. Skills above
                        15 are pretty much unheard of, though there is no
                        theoretical limit to how high skills can go.
                    </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Techniques</title>

                    <para>
                        Techniques are specialities bought within a
                        particular skill. They enable you to perform actions
                        that would be impossible or hard without it, or
                        grant a bonus in certain situations (sometimes to
                        related skills).
                    </para>
                </sect3>
            </sect2>

            <sect2>
                <title>Setting and Style</title>

                <para>
                    <tm>YAGS</tm> does not try to cover all possible settings
                    in one set of rules. What is provided here is a wide
                    range of skills and background options, but only enough
                    to cover the 'modern world'. There are no options for
                    magic, since how magic is learnt and used can differ
                    from setting to setting. Likewise, there are no skills
                    to cover piloting space craft or operating energy shields
                    or matter transmitters, since again how these work
                    differs between science fiction settings. Individual
                    world books will contain the unique information necessary
                    to build characters for these settings.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Finally, it is up to the Game Master to decide on the
                    level of the campaign - <e>Mundane</e>, <e>Skilled</e>,
                    <e>Exceptional</e>, <e>Heroic</e> or <e>Pulp Action</e>,
                    and any other limits in place on
                    the choice of characters and backgrounds.

                <title>Supplementary Articles</title>

                <para>
                    <tm>YAGS</tm> is split into several articles, of which
                    this is one, and a good place to start if you want to
                    create a character for yourself. Its focus is on characters
                    for modern settings, and though the rules will work for
                    any type of character, the listed skills are limited to
                    those that a modern character may find useful.
                </para>

                <para>
                    There are a number of articles which supplement
                    <tm>Characters</tm> in a modern setting.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The <tm>Core Rules</tm> provide a detailed description of
                    the underlying rules, and are mostly aimed at GMs wanting
                    a setting and genre agnostic view onto the system.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The <tm>Bestiary</tm> covers everything to do with animals
                    and creatures, including providing statistics for the most
                    commonly encountered animals.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Finally, <tm>High Tech</tm> describes weapons and equipment
                    for the modern era - from 1900 to the present day. It also
                    covers vehicles and rules for using them in a game.

            <title>Your Character</title>

            <para>
                Building a character for <tm>YAGS</tm> is a relatively
                straightforward process. There are many choices
                available however, and as always it helps to have a good
                idea of your character concept before you start. The
                setting of the campaign will tend to limit this, and
                your GM may have some suggestions as to what type of
                characters will find a useful role to play.
            </para>

            <para>
                <tm>YAGS</tm> is point based, and the number of points you
                get to spend depend on the level of the game that the
                GM will be running. You get three point pools to spend
                from - <s>Attributes</s>, <s>Experience</s> and
                <s>Advantages</s>. Your first task is to prioritise
                these according to the type of character you wish to
                play. You must choose one pool as your <e>Primary</e>,
                one as your <e>Secondary</e> and the last as your
                <e>Tertiary</e> pool. The Primary pool gets the most
                points to spend, and the Tertiary the least.
            </para>

            <note title="Point Pools">
                <para>
                    The points you get to create a character with are
                    divided into a number of different <e>pools</e>.
                    This division serves two purposes. Firstly, it helps
                    to focus character design into easier to understand
                    chunks. Secondly, it helps to limit possible abuses of
                    the design process by preventing players from
                    making extreme choices.
                </para>
            </note>

            <para>
                The pools are not necessarily equal, but which are the
                most useful will depend on the type of campaign and
                the type of character that you wish to build.

                    <para>
                        Your <e>attributes</e> define the raw potential of
                        your character. A character with good attributes

                        quickly. They can be fit, healthy, intelligent and
                        charismatic. Whether attributes can be raised after
                        character generation depends on the campaign style.

                        Hollywood action heroes will tend to have high
                        attributes. A character with high attributes and
                        low skills represents the gifted amateur who learns
                        to quickly supersede their mentors.

                        maximum level any single attribute can be. This

                        useful skills in specialised areas.

                    <para>
                        Heroes often have some out of the ordinary feature
                        which separates them from normal people.
                        <e>Advantages</e> represent these features. By
                        purchasing advantages, you can make your character
                        special in a certain way, either physically,
                        supernaturally or through background options such
                        as wealth or high status.

                    <para>
                        When you prioritise advantages, you define how many
                        points of advantages you may buy. You always have the
                        option to purchase a single disadvantage, which will
                        provide you with extra points for more advantages.
                        This may be a '-1' disadvantage which gives you a
                        single extra point, or a '-2' or '-3' which give
                        more points.

                    <para>
                        For every full 3 points of advantages you are given,
                        you may take an extra disadvantage for further
                        points. Again, it is the number of disadvantages
                        that is limited, not the total value of them.

                    <para>
                        Lastly, advantages are your character's <e>Schick</e>,
                        and as such can't be purchased after character
                        generation. They are also more durable than equivalents
                        gained through play. If you buy <e>Rich</e>, it is
                        much harder to lose your wealth than if you had obtained
                        it in-game.

                    Before you can begin character generation the GM will
                    have set the starting level of the campaign and dictated
                    the type of characters you will be playing. <e>Mundane</e>
                    campaigns are about mostly normal people, so are suitable
                    for horror games and low fantasy. <e>Exceptional</e>
                    campaigns are about skilled and experienced people, and
                    are suitable for mid-level fantasy or science fiction
                    campaigns. <e>Heroic</e> games are about larger than
                    life people similar to Hollywood action heroes.

                    <para>
                        Mundane campaigns are about normal people in abnormal
                        situations (or even normal people in normal situations).
                        In this type of campaign, characters are somewhat
                        above average, but not significantly so.

                    <para>
                        This level of campaign is suitable for modern horror,
                        or stories about young, inexperienced knights at
                        the start of their careers. There is no reason that
                        characters in such campaigns can't grow to become
                        heroic, but the story is often about their progression
                        rather than what they do once they become heroes.

                        The majority of people in the world will be of the

                        <e>Tertiary</e> level in each of the three categories.
                        Skilled professionals will tend to have <e>Primary</e>
                        experience however.

                        For a truly mundane game, characters may be
                        limited to taking two <e>Secondary</e> and one
                        <e>Tertiary</e> selections, or even a single
                        <e>Secondary</e> and two <e>Tertiary</e>. This
                        however would not normally be recommended, since
                        such characters will be very limited in what
                        they can do.

                        than two skills at this level is going to be
                        tricky unless <e>experience</e> is your primary
                        pool. You may want to back up your professional
                        skills with some talents which are slightly cheaper
                        to raise to 4 (since they start at 2) and maybe
                        some techniques to give you that important edge.

                        when the GM wants reasonably average characters,
                        but where their backgrounds imply more than the

                        is a horror game where everything is meant to be

                        techniques you can purchase for that skill.

                        Unless you really need to do otherwise in order to
                        fit your character concept, it is recommended that
                        <e>advantages</e> are selected as a tertiary. You can
                        take a single (or two, if you have 3+ points to spend
                        on advantages) disadvantage of any cost to give you
                        extra points to spend on advantages. In the example
                        of Jenny Galloway, she takes <e>alcoholism</e> as a
                        -3 disadvantage which gives her a total of 4 points
                        to spend on advantages.

                        If you are playing in an exceptional campaign, then you
                        will begin with a character who is well above average in
                        both attributes and skills however you prioritise your

                        Such campaigns are about exceptional people and high
                        adventure. Most of the people you meet will not be as
                        good as you, allowing you to take on greater dangers
                        than in less high powered campaigns. However, by the
                        start of the campaign you are already a professional
                        in what you do. Such stories are not about a farm boy
                        (or school teacher) who gets caught up in an adventure
                        by accident, but about adventurers who go looking for
                        something exciting.

            <para>
                For player characters, attributes are generally rated on a
                scale of 1 to 10, with human PCs falling within the range
                of 2-8. Anything outside of the range 2-5 however is
                significantly unusual for an adult human, and a typical
                adult will have all their attributes at 3.
            </para>

            <para>
                The number of points that may be spent on buying up an
                attribute depends on the priority you chose for attributes
                and the level of campaign that is being run.

                Levels outside of the range 2-8 cannot be purchased,

                a bonus or penalty to a given attribute, and this
                bonus applies after you have purchased the attribute.
                You may not purchase an attribute to a level that
                would cause it to be shifted outside of the 1-10
                range once species modifiers have been applied.

                        Health is used in checks to remain alive after
                        being seriously wounded. It also directly affects

                        emotionally, or to tell if someone is lying to
                        you. Empathy doesn't affect your intentions
                        to be nice or nasty, but does affect how well
                        you notice other people's feelings.

                Advantages allow you to personalise your character

                (e.g., you could find a dragon hoard and become <e>Rich</e>),

                    Taking an <e>advantage</e> provides you with a

                    If you do lose an <e>advantage</e>, there should be

                    if you are a <e>Rich</e> American businessman, and lose
                    everything when forced to flee your country due to some
                    'misunderstanding', then the GM should provide some
                    in-game opportunity to obtain wealth some other way.
                    It doesn't mean it should be easy, but the opportunity
                    should be there, and may be the main focus of the plot

                        like other skills. Instead, the level of skill

                        In some settings it is normal for the majority of
                        people to have some form of education. Rather than

                        For a 'western' education, it can be assumed that

                        A default skill may also restrict the type of

                        be used to barter, and isn't much use if the
                        character needs to know the real value of goods.

                        Under some genres, a skill may be <e>limited</e>
                        by another skill. This concept is mostly limited to
                        knowledge or science skills. When a skill is limited
                        by another skill, the first skill may never be more
                        than half the score of the second.

                        limited by Natural Philosophy. If you have
                        a Natural Philosophy of 7, then your Science
                        cannot be higher than 3 (since raising it any higher
                        would make it greater than 3.5). Once your
                        Natural Philosophy has been raised to
                        8, then you may begin to raise your Science to 4.

                    <para>
                        A <e>Technique</e> is a specialisation of a skill,
                        and may provide bonuses or allow some particular
                        special action to be attempted. A skill may have
                        several techniques associated with it, and some
                        techniques can be used with more than one skill.
                        In the latter case, the technique only needs to
                        be purchased once - it can then be used with any
                        skill which uses it, as long as the skill is of
                        sufficient level.

                    <para>
                        A technique has a cost associated with it, which is
                        the number of experience points which need to be
                        spent to buy it. A level 6 technique costs 6 points
                        to buy. The cost of the technique is also the
                        minimum skill level that must be achieved before
                        the technique can be purchased. If you do not have
                        the required skill at a sufficient level, then the
                        technique can't be bought.

                        Finally, a technique may have a prerequisite. These

                        technique can be learnt.

                            nuclear bomb, then that's quite a deep specialisation, and
                            require a base difficulty of 40 for a simple design.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            If you had a specialisation in <e>Nuclear Weapons</e>, then
                            designing becomes a standard task, so would only be
                            difficulty 10. If your specialisation was <e>Nuclear Physics</e>,
                            then bomb design is relatively specialised, so might be 20.
                            Likewise, designing a nuclear power station might also be 20.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            There is no limit to how broad or narrow a specialisation may
                            be. The broader it is, the more topics it covers, but each
                            topic will be a deeper specialisation. It is recommended
                            (though not required) that you take levels of specialisations,
                            starting with broad topics and narrowing down. Being specialised
                            in <e>Nuclear Weapons</e> without having at least a <e>Physics</e>
                            specialisation would require some explaining.

                    Techniques represent specialist training in a particular
                    use of a skill. They can provide a bonus in certain
                    situations, or allow you to perform an action which
                    wouldn't otherwise be possible.

                    <para>
                        Techniques can be viewed as an optional part of
                        the game system. They add a lot of flavour and
                        detail to the skill system, and provide a means
                        to differentiate between characters who simply
                        have raw talent (high attributes and basic skill)
                        and those how are highly trained (high skill
                        with a lot of techniques). However, there can be
                        quite a few to keep track of.

                        If you wish a simpler system, then ignoring

                        major problems. Adding them in later is also
                        possible, simply by allowing players to start
                        purchasing them.

                        specialisation within a subject - so the

            <title>Improvement</title>

            <para>
                A central facet of many RPGs is that a character can improve
                as the game progressions. This isn't a universal rule however,
                and it suits some type of fiction better than others. Much
                fantasy fiction revolves around a young, inexperienced hero
                with much untapped potential gaining that experience, and
                becoming a skilled champion in an infeasibly short period of
                time. Modern or science fiction tends to focus on already
                experienced characters who need to use their existing skills
                to survive. There are many examples which go against this
                trend, but it can be a useful distinction to make.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Heroic Experience</title>

                <para>
                    If, as a GM, you wish characters to improve rapidly in
                    their skill sets, then it is suggested that experience
                    is handed out at the end of each gaming session,
                    possibly 1-3 points. Players can use this to improve
                    their character's skills or techniques, at a maximum of
                    1 point on any single skill per session, and possibly
                    limited to skills which could sensibly have improved.
                </para>

                <para>
                    This gives players a lot of control over what skills
                    go up, and will tend to lead to PCs having a few high
                    skills. Note that this does allow characters to go
                    from totally untrained to professional level (4) in

                    few weeks of game time.

                    Instead of placing experience onto a skill, the player
                    may place it into a technique. There is no limit to how
                    many experience points can be placed into a single
                    technique at once, which can make it easier to buy
                    techniques than to put up the skill.

                    Optionally, a point may be granted at the end of each
                    story arc (or at dramatically appropriate moments)
                    which may be spent on attributes. Attributes can be
                    raised in the same way as skills - 1 point per level
                    of attribute you are raising to. This shouldn't amount
                    to more than a few points a year for young characters,
                    or more than a point a year for more experienced
                    characters.

                    Alternatively, it may be desired to opt for a slower
                    approach to skill improvement that is somewhat more
                    realistic. This allows characters to pick up
                    experience during down time within the game, rather
                    than from actual adventures.
                </para>

                    <para>
                        Characters in a new area may pick up language and
                        area lore skills if they don't already have them.
                        If they have a skill less than 2, they <e>may</e>
                        gain 1 XP towards these skills each week they have
                        an opportunity to learn. If they have a skill of
                        2-3, then they <e>may</e> gain 1 XP each month.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Each week or month of game time, roll a d20, and on
                        a 10+ you gain 1 XP towards the skill. Once the skill
                        reaches 4, it won't improve in this way. This does
                        assume that you are interacting with other people
                        (in the case of language) or exploring (for area
                        lore). If you aren't doing this at all, then no
                        XP will be gained. If you are doing it in a limited
                        way, then you need a 15+. If the have the <e>Tourist</e>
                        advantage, then you gain a bonus to this roll.

                    <para>
                        It is reasonable to combine this advancement option
                        with heroic experience. Doing so allows characters to
                        focus on the skills that matter to their character
                        concept, without sacrificing knowledge skills they
                        would realistically be picking up.

                    <para>
                        Similar to <e>Background Experience</e>, it can be
                        assumed that you will pick up knowledge related to
                        a job. If you are performing full-time duties which
                        require skill use, then you may pick up experience
                        on the job. Many skills will have multiple skills
                        associated with them, in which case choose the most
                        appropriate, or the lowest skill.

                    <para>
                        Skill gain is similar to <e>Background Experience</e>,
                        so you have a chance of gaining a point each week if
                        your skill is less than two, or each month if it is
                        less than four.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        As before, you are limited to gaining a skill of 4
                        (professional level) in this way, and it should take
                        about 16 months to get to this level.

                        It is possible for this experience to be put into
                        familiarity or specialisation techniques.

                    <para>
                        It is always possible to gain skill through dedicated
                        training in that skill. This requires finding a tutor,
                        often paying them for their time. A training session
                        takes a week for techniques, or if your current skill
                        is less than four. For higher skills, it takes a month.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        As for other methods of learning, roll a d20 to see if
                        you gain any experience in the trained skill. For
                        techniques or skills less than 4, the target is 10+.
                        For skills up to 7, the target is 15+ and if your
                        current skill is 8 or higher, the target is 20+.

                        the <e>Teach</e> skill, then reduce the difficulty by
                        the level of their skill.

                        must have a skill of at least 4, and at least half the
                        student's current skill otherwise training is not

                        technique. If the roll is 10 or more over the target
                        difficulty, gain 2 XP instead.

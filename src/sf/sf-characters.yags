            <para>
                The standard character generation rules for <s>YAGS</s> assume
                a generic, modern, setting. Though the mechanics are pretty
                much the same between all settings, the skills and backgrounds
                available to characters can change depending on setting and
                genre. What you are reading here is everything you need to know
                to create a character in a <e>Science Fiction</e> setting.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                The term Science Fiction is pretty broad though, and <s>YAGS</s>
                divides it into two generic types. Specifically, these rules
                detail <e>SciFi</e> - the Hollywood-esque Science Fiction of
                laser guns and space ships. Humans (or small furry creatures
                from Alpha Centauri) are the centre of the action in stories
                within <s>YAGS SciFi</s>, not the technology. In Hollywood
                terms the science is pretty hard - it's not the <e>Star Wars</e>
                end of the spectrum, but more <e>Aliens</e> or <e>Babylon 5</e>.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                If you want the Science Fiction of books, where FTL is an
                impossible dream, or where humanity is on the verge of a
                technological singularity, then take a look at
                <s>YAGS Ultra Tech</s>.
            </para>

            <para>
                The sort of assumptions that are made by these rules concern
                the type of technology available, and the type of societies
                that Player Characters will come from, can be summed up as
                follows:
            </para>

            <itemlist order="strict">
                <item name="Human centric">
                    Many people within the campaign are human, or at least
                    human enough such that they don't require special rules.
                    Aliens can range from non-existant or rare, to reasonably
                    common. However, they are generally understandable by
                    humans and not utterly exotic.
                </item>

                <item name="Star Spanning Empire">
                    Most of humanity is spread across a single Imperium
                    that spans tens of thousands of star systems, and
                    travel between these systems is relatively common
                    and cheap.
                </item>

                <item name="Jump drives">
                    FTL travel is by a jump drive or hyperspace technology
                    which can travel a few light years a day. FTL communication 
                    faster than this may or may not be possible.
                </item>

                <item name="Meat space">
                    Something prevents run away computing power in the
                    early 21st century, making true AIs very rare, and
                    reducing the effects of Cyberspace realities. Humans are
                    needed to fly spaceships, fire weapons and generally go
                    out and do things.
                </item>
                
                <item name="Magically Efficient Space Drives">
                    There are no reactionless drives, but what there is would
                    be considered magical by today's standards. It's possible
                    to cross a typical solar system in days to weeks.
                </item>
                
                <item name="Psionics">
                    There may or may not be Psionics, or the ability to
                    manipulate reality with the mind. This could be limited to
                    plain old telepathy, or more allow more exotic abilities.
                </item>
            </itemlist>

            <para>
                These assumptions are designed to allow star spanning heroic
                fiction, not totally unlike that found in certain classic
                RPG systems from the 1970s, or similar to TV SciFi shows such
                as <e>Babylon 5</e>, <e>Firefly</e> or <e>Farscape</e>. High
                technology is possible, and it is possible to centre a
                campaign on who has the biggest and best equipment, but people
                are still needed to control that equipment. Computers are
                regulated to making life easier.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                One final assumption is that Player Characters are at least
                competent professionals, with options for them starting at
                even higher levels of competence. As such, ability progression
                isn't considered a focus of the campaign. You could tweak
                things to start as a farmboy who turns into an ace fighter
                pilot who murders thousands of civilian contractors with a
                single well placed shot, but that's not the aim of these rules.
            </para>

                <title>Some Definitions</title>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Attributes</title>

                    <para>
                        There are 8 primary attributes to define, and all
                        begin with a score of 3 (which is average for an
                        adult human). The minimum for any attribute is 2,
                        the maximum is 8, though anything above 5 is
                        considered to be <e>very</e> exceptional.
                    </para>

                    <itemlist order="strict">
                        <item name="Strength">
                            How strong you are, including your ability to
                            lift and hurt things. If you have a high
                            strength then you will tend to be larger as
                            well.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Health">
                            A measure of your physical fitness and stamina.
                            Health is used in checks to remain alive after
                            being seriously wounded.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Agility">
                            Your agility represents your quickness, athletic
                            prowess and balance. It is used for brawling,
                            wrestling, sneaking, reaction tests and acrobatics.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Dexterity">
                            Dexterity is your hand-eye coordination,
                            sleight-of-hand and skill with melee weapons.
                            Pistols also use dexterity, and rifles may
                            use dexterity or perception.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Perception">
                            How alert you are, and the general quality of
                            your senses. If perceptive, you are good at
                            hiding and noticing things. Rifles and larger
                            weapons use perception.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Intelligence">
                            A measure of your wit, cunning, memory and
                            intuition. Knowledges are based on intelligence,
                            as are logic and reasoning skills.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Empathy">
                            Empathy is your ability to understand others.
                            It is used to make friends, convince people
                            emotionally, or to tell if someone is lying to
                            you. Empathy doesn't affect your intentions
                            to be nice or nasty, but does affect how well
                            you notice other people's feelings.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Will">
                            Your Will is a measure of mental fortitude,
                            being used to resist psi, instincts and
                            emotions. A high Will makes you a good liar,
                            a low Will means you are gullible and likely
                            to give in to fear, lust and greed.

                    <title>Skills</title>

                    <para>
                        Skills are abilities which are gained through study,
                        experience and training. There are 8 basic skills
                        (talents) which all being at a score of 2, all other
                        skills are assumed to start at zero unless stated
                        otherwise for your background.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A skill of 4 is considered to be a trained
                        professional, 6 is an expert, 8 is elite and 10+
                        is a true master of the profession. Skills above
                        15 are pretty much unheard of.

                    <para>
                        Techniques are specialities bought within a
                        particular skill. They enable you to perform actions
                        that would be impossible or hard without it, or
                        grant a bonus in certain situations (sometimes to
                        related skills).

                <para>
                    The following example characters should give an idea of what
                    is possible using <s>Yags</s>. They have all been built using
                    the character generation system given here. Each states the
                    order of priorities chosen at character generation time.

            <title>Building a Character</title>

            <para>
                Designing a character for <s>YAGS SF</s> is a
                relatively straightforward process. As always, you will
                need a character concept before hand, which will depend
                on the type of campaign being run by the GM, the type
                of characters everybody else is taking, and your
                personal preference.
            </para>

            <para>
                There are no set character classes to choose from, instead
                abilities are purchased from a number of point pools -
                attributes, experience and background. Which of these is
                given priority (and so has the most points available) is
                up to you.
            </para>

            <para>
                Characters begin the game very experienced, potentially
                equivalent to action heroes. However, there will be others
                who are better than they are.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Priorities</title>

                <para>
                    Once you have determined the type of character you wish
                    to play, it is time to determine the priorities of that
                    character.
                </para>

                <itemlist order="sort">
                    <item name="Attributes">
                        A typical adult human has a score of 3 in every
                        attribute. By prioritising this, you may start
                        with more attributes at a much higher level.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Experience">
                        Covers general experience and governs how many
                        skills you start with, as well as the maximum skill
                        level of any one skill at generation time. These
                        points can be spent on any skills and techniques.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Background">
                        Allows you to choose some special advantages for
                        your character, from wealth and social status to
                        psionic ability. If you want to play a non-human,
                        then this is also a background cost.
                    </item>
                </itemlist>

                <para>
                    When designing your character, you should choose which
                    area will be primary, which secondary and which tertiary.
                    Your choice only affects the number of points placed
                    into each area at character generation, and has no
                    effect after this point.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The above three groups determine all aspects of your
                    character according to the rules. Before players can
                    make their decisions however, the GM (and the group)
                    needs to decide what the general level of the campaign
                    will be. This determines how good PCs are when they
                    start, and indirectly the type of adventures they will
                    be getting involved in.

                        For player characters, attributes are generally
                        rated on a scale of 1 to 10. Humans are limited to
                        a range of 2 to 8, though some aliens can go outside
                        of this. A typical adult human is considered to have
                        a score of 3 in each attribute. A description of what
                        the various levels represent, and their costs, are
                        given in the table below.

                        The number of points that may be spent on buying
                        up an attribute depends on the priority you chose
                        for attributes - 12 points for primary, 6 for
                        secondary and only 3 for tertiary. This choice
                        also limits the maximum you may buy an attribute up
                        to.

            <para>
                There are a wide range of skills available to Imperium
                characters, the most common of which are described here.
                There is a focus on those skills which are common within
                the high technology of the Imperium, and though low tech
                skills can be learnt, they are uncommon and are described
                elsewhere.
            </para>

            <para>
                There is a high level of education throughout most of the
                Imperium, and the huge economic base means that people
                can afford to spend longer specialising in one area.
                As such, higher level skills will encountered more often,
                even if only finding a specialist is a lot easier when
                you can just search for their website.
            </para>

            <para>
                A skill at a level of '2' represents those who have basic
                familiarity with the skill. A skill of 2 is sufficient to
                drive a car safely, operate a computer with confidence,
                or fire a gun reasonably on a firing range.
            </para>

            <para>
                A skill at a level of '4' represents having good knowledge
                of a subject. Most people will have a skill of at least 4
                in the primary skills necessary for their jobs, or in those
                skills they've been using on a regular basis for a long
                time. A person who has driven a car for many years probably
                has a Drive of 4; office administrators probably have
                Computer operation and Administration at 4. Most regular
                army personnel will have 4 in basic combat skills.

                A skill of '6' represents special training or lots of
                experience. The difference between someone who has done
                something a lot, and someone who has had advanced training,
                is often represented by the latter knowing a lot of
                <e>techniques</e> related to that skill.

            <para>
                A skill of '8' or above is normally only held by those who
                have studied or trained very hard. Special forces operatives
                may have 8 or more in their primary skill, and well known
                academics will also have this sort of level.

                        Most skills are considered to be <e>standard

                        easily, including being self taught. They can also
                        be used by a character who has a skill of zero,
                        though such an attempt fumbles on a natural one
                        or two.

                    <para>
                        Talents are skills which are known by everyone
                        from childhood onwards. They are treated just as
                        standard skills, with the exception that all
                        characters start with a skill level of two in all
                        talents.

                        There are only eight talents, and are listed by

                        sometimes marked with an asterix (*).

                        A knowledge is a special type of skill which cannot
                        be attempted unless the character has a skill level
                        of at least one. They can rarely be self taught,
                        requiring a teacher or study aid (such as a book)
                        to learn from.

                    <title>Languages</title>

                    <para>
                        Language skills are treated on a scale from
                        one to four, and are not normally 'rolled'
                        like other skills. Instead, the level of skill
                        gives a guide to how much of a conversation a
                        character can understand.

                            The character can recognise the language

                            in the market or in an inn.

                            conversation. They will obviously still be
                            a foreigner however, and many unusual words
                            will be beyond their understanding.

                            still have an accent, but they will not
                            have any problems communicating.

                    <para>
                        Some skills have a default - this will generally be
                        one of the <e>talents</e>. If desired, the default
                        can be used instead, but the result (after the die
                        roll) is halved, plus the chance of fumbling is
                        doubled.

                    <para>
                        A default skill may also restrict the type of
                        tasks which are possible. For example, <e>Trade</e>
                        defaults to <e>Guile</e>, but the latter can only
                        be used to barter, and isn't much use if the
                        character needs to know the real value of goods.

                    <title>Pre-requisites</title>

                    <para>
                        A few skills have pre-requisites. Before this skill
                        can be purchased at level one, all pre-requisites
                        must be met. A skill like Physics might have a
                        pre-requisite of Mathematics-2 and Science-2 for
                        example, which means both skills must be known at
                        level 2 before buying physics.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Further, the main skill may never be more than
                        double the level of any of the pre-requisites. A
                        physicist would have to raise their Mathematics
                        and Science to at least 3, before raising
                        Physics to 6.

                    <para>
                        A character cannot put points into a skill if the
                        next level of skill is not allowed.

                    <para>
                        Under some genres, a skill may be <e>limited</e>
                        by another skill. This concept is mostly limited to
                        knowledge or science skills. When a skill is limited
                        by another skill, the first skill may never be more
                        than half the score of the second.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        For example, during the <e>Enlightenment</e>, when
                        Science was being discovered, the Science skill is
                        limited by Natural Philosophy. If a character has
                        a Natural Philosophy of 7, then their Science
                        cannot be higher than 3 (since raising it any higher
                        would make it greater than 3.5). Once the
                        character's Natural Philosophy has been raised to
                        8, then they can begin to raise their Science to 4.

                        A character cannot put points into a skill if the

                    <title>Skill Techniques</title>

                    <para>
                        A <e>Technique</e> is a specialisation of a skill,
                        and may provide bonuses or allow some particular
                        special action to be attempted. A skill may have
                        several techniques associated with it, and some
                        techniques can be used with more than one skill.
                        In the latter case, the technique only needs to
                        be purchased once - it can then be used with any
                        skill which uses it, as long as the skill is of
                        sufficient level.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A technique has a cost associated with it, which is
                        the number of experience points which need to be
                        spent to buy it. A level 6 technique costs 6 points
                        to buy. The cost of the technique is also the
                        minimum skill level that must be achieved before
                        the technique can be purchased. If you do not have
                        the required skill at a sufficient level, then the
                        technique can't be bought.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Finally, a technique may have a prerequisite. These
                        are the techniques which must be known before this
                        technique can be learnt.

                <para>
                    Techniques are a way to specialise within a skill.
                    Generally they are the result of specialist training
                    rather than experience, so will mark the difference
                    between the talented amateur and the professional.
                    Some techniques allow you to perform actions which
                    are not possible without the technique.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A technique may be learnt when the skill it is based on
                    (which may be a group of skills) reaches the level of
                    the technique. The cost to learn the technique is equal
                    to its level, and any prerequisite techniques must have
                    already been purchased.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Techniques are purchased from the same experience point
                    pool that skills are purchased from.

                    <title>Academic Techniques</title>

                    <para>
                        The Academic techniques cover the sciences and
                        other areas of knowledge. Generally, each is a
                        specialisation within a subject - so the
                        <e>Physics</e> skill will have techniques for
                        <e>Nuclear Physics</e>, <e>Relativity</e> etc.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A specialisation technique halves the difficulty
                        of tasks within the specialisation. If a technique
                        for a specialisation doesn't exist, then make it
                        up. Most academic specialisations are level 4.
                        Those which are for cutting edge specialisations
                        might be 6 or 8.

                    <para>
                        There are a small number of basic vehicle skills,
                        and familiarity is required for specific vehicle
                        types. For example, <e>Pilot</e> will enable you
                        to fly any type of aircraft, though your skill roll
                        is halved if you aren't familiar with a particular
                        type.

                    <para>
                        Familiarity is gained by purchasing a technique, so
                        many of the vehicle techniques are for familiarity.
                        If you aren't familiar with a type of vehicle, then
                        you cannot use any techniques with that vehicle.

            <title>Experience and Advancement</title>

            <para>
                Over the course of your adventures, you will gain the
                opportunity to learn new skills and improve existing ones.
                Some of this improvement will come directly from adventures,
                but most of it will be gained during downtime with training
                and learning.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Experience</title>

                <para>
                    Whilst performing exciting acts of heroism (or dastardly
                    acts of greed, your choice), you may get the opportunity
                    to improve an existing skill or learn a new one.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If you currently have no score in a skill, but get the
                    opportunity to try the skill, then you may gain a single
                    point of experience in that skill. This may only be
                    done with skills which could reasonably be improved
                    through exposure in this way. Firing a gun (pistol),
                    trying to find a black market dealer (streetwise) or
                    applying bandages (first aid) are all skills which
                    a little bit of practise can get you started.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If you already have a skill, but it is at a level of 3
                    or less, then it could also improve. If you use the skill
                    extensively, or use it in an ingenious way, then you
                    can also gain a point of experience in it.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Once a skill reaches a level of 4, it will not improve
                    in this way.

                    It is assumed that most characters spend most of their
                    time not actually in 'adventures'. Much of this
                    downtime will be spent performing their normal daily
                    routine jobs, relaxing or training. If the party are
                    merchant traders, then this time will probably be
                    spent shipping routine goods. If they are part of
                    a military organisation, then they are probably
                    on routine duty, training, or catching up on R&amp;R.

                    If time is spent training, then a typical training
                    session is assumed to take a month. A month of
                    training will be in a single skill. <e>Intensive</e>
                    training may reduce the time to as little as a
                    week (some military training may be like this).
                    Few people can put up with this sort of intensive
                    training for more than a few sessions of this
                    sort of intense effort however. If you want,
                    assume that a month of training consists of some
                    intensive training plus routine downtime.

                        For every XP you already have in the technique,
                        reduce the difficulty by 3.

                        A specialist training course may teach multiple
                        techniques. In this case, add up the total of
                        all the techniques and treat them as a single
                        roll. The lowest level techniques are always
                        learnt first. No more than 1 technique per
                        2 levels of <e>Teach</e> skill can be taught.

            <para>
                The Imperium is populated with a wide range of character
                types, some of which are listed below. These are examples
                of a typical member of a profession, and most of them are
                far less experienced than player characters will be.
            </para>

            <para>
                Individual NPCs will likely have some hobby and secondary
                skills as well - only those skills related to the profession
                are listed. Other skills are unlikely to be higher than 2.

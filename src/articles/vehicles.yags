            <para>
                <tm>Yags</tm> is all about characters and the things that
                they can do. But sometimes a character wants to do something
                bigger, faster and more awesome than they can manage with
                their frail fleshy bodies. For this reason <tm>Yags</tm>
                also includes these rules for vehicles.
            </para>

            <para>
                The term <e>vehicle</e> can also be extended to cover all
                forms of constructs, from scary killer robots to fortresses
                and giant space ships. More mundanely, it also covers
                trains, planes and cars. There are sections to cover combat
                between vehicles, since the sort of very big guns that
                military vehicles have a tendency to carry step outside the
                bounds of character scale combat.

            <para>
                In brief, vehicles mostly the same rules as characters.
                There are some changes to account for the differences in
                size, but a most things are additional, the character
                rules merely being one end of a sliding scale.

                <para>
                    Whether something counts as a vehicle is based on its
                    construction rather than its size. Generally, something
                    that has been built out of non-living material is
                    classed as a vehicle. It is not based on size - a
                    motorbike is vehicle scale whilst an elephant is still
                    character scale.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Vehicles also include buildings, so a house uses vehicle
                    rules as far as absorbing damage is concerned.
                </para>

                <para>
                    All vehicles have a <t>Size</t> statistic, just like
                    characters do. This is on the same scale, so a <t>Size</t> 5
                    motorbike is about the same size as an adult human.
                    A vehicle's <t>Size</t> is roughly proportional to its
                    volume. A <t>Size</t> 5 vehicle is about 1 cubic metre.
                    Every ten fold increase in volume adds +5 to the <t>Size</t>.
                    Some examples of vehicle sizes are below.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Because of the logarithmic scale, even very large Science Fiction
                    starships can be represented in double digit sizes.
                    Since attacks can't damage targets more than 15 size
                    points larger, damage and armour values can also
                    remain relatively low.

                    <title>Vehicle Damage</title>

                    <para>
                        Damage, and the absorption thereof, is considered to be
                        on a different scale to characters. Unless noted, weapons
                        and armour are <e>character scale</e>. Anything to do with
                        a vehicle tends to be <e>vehicle scale</e>, and will be
                        specified with a 'Vc' in its properties. A vehicle scale
                        weapon that does +20 damage is far more effective than
                        a character scale weapon which does the same.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Vehicles don't have wounds and stuns, but they do have
                        <e>damage</e>. This is based on the vehicle's <t>Size</t>,
                        though isn't directly proportional to it. Instead, it is
                        equal to the square of the vehicle's <t>Size</t>, divided
                        by 20:
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Damage levels = <t>Size</t>^2 / 20 (round to nearest) + 2.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        There are 3 damage levels - superficial, moderate and
                        critical. A vehicle that has taken superficial damage
                        is at no penalty to manoeuvring, a moderately damaged
                        vehicle is at -10 and a critically damaged vehicle is
                        at -25 and halves its top speed and acceleration.
                        In addition, a vehicle always has one damage level in
                        <e>disabled</e>, which gives a -40 penalty. A vehicle
                        stops working once it becomes disabled, though it's
                        possible to get it working again with a difficulty 20
                        <e>Mechanics</e> check (takes 1 round per point of
                        <e>Size</e> of the vehicle).
                    </para>

                    <example title="Damage Levels">
                        <para>
                            As an example, take a modern BMW M3, with a
                            Size of 9. It will have 4 body levels
                            (9 * 9 = 81, divided by 20 = 4), plus the two
                            free levels for a total of 6.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            The first five get split between superficial (2),
                            moderate (2) and critical (1), and the sixth
                            goes into disabled (1).
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            The first two points of damage the car takes will
                            leave it as <e>superficially damaged</e>. On taking
                            its third level it becomes <e>moderately damaged</e>.
                            This is similar to how character scale damage works.
                        </para>
                    </example>

                    <para>
                        There are two types of vehicle damage - <e>Major</e>
                        and <e>Minor</e>. The former is the default type and
                        is similar to <e>wounds</e> at character scale.
                        <e>Minor</e> damage is like <e>stuns</e> and is non
                        cumulative, but is applied to the same damage track
                        as <e>Major</e> damage. Generally, damage from
                        character scale weapons is <e>Minor</e> damage.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        When a vehicle receives <e>Major</e> damage, the
                        damage is added directly to the damage track. If
                        a vehicle has 4 damage, and takes 3 points of
                        <e>Major</e> damage, it now has 7 damage.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        <e>Minor</e> damage represents dents and scratches
                        which are unlikely to take a vehicle out of
                        commission. Every two points of <e>Minor</e> damage
                        adds one to the damage track if the vehicle is no
                        more than superficially damaged.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Three points of <e>Minor</e> damage are required to
                        damage a vehicle that already has moderate damage,
                        and five points if it is already critically damaged.
                    </para>

                        <para>
                            A size 28 battleship has 41 (39 + 2) damage levels,
                            with 14 in superficial, 13 in moderate, 13 in
                            critical and a final one in disabled.

                            It is being fired on by a small artillery gun
                            (effective size 15) that is doing
                            minor damage. The first two shots do 13 levels
                            each, causing 6 damage twice, taking it to 12 levels
                            (still superficial). The third shot also does
                            13 levels. The first four points do two points of
                            damage on the superficial track, and the remaining
                            nine points do three damage (1 per 3) on the
                            moderate damage track.

                            If a vehicle is attacked with a character scale
                            weapon, then the damage roll is halved and the
                            damage caused is <e>Minor</e>. Any vehicle which
                            is more than 10 <t>Size</t> points larger than the
                            weapon (normally vehicles of <t>Size</t> 16+)
                            take no damage from character scale attacks.
                            Also, only <e>wounds</e> are converted to
                            vehicle damage - stuns are ignored.

                            Man portable firearms are generally considered to
                            be <t>Size</t> 5, though specialist anti-vehicle
                            weapons may be larger. The most effective of these
                            are generally classed as vehicle scale anyway.

                        <para>
                            If a character weapon happens to be 5+ size

                            the damage caused is <e>major</e> damage. If the
                            weapon is 10+ size points larger, then the damage
                            roll is not halved. Outside of fantasy, such
                            events will tend to be limited to elephants trampling
                            a motorcycle.

                        <para>
                            If a vehicle scale weapon is used against characters
                            then the character receives no soak roll unless they
                            are fully protected with heavy armour. In the latter
                            case then their soak roll is 'merely' halved.

                            vehicle (e.g. a turret mounted light machine gun)
                            is still considered character scale. It is the size
                            and characteristics of the weapon, not the vehicle,
                            which are important.

                            ignored. Characters also suffer the multiplication
                            of damage from oversized vehicle attacks (see below),
                            but normally it's irrelevant by this point.

                            When combat happens between vehicles, a lot of the
                            time passengers will end up being the target. This
                            can be either due to deliberate aiming, or through
                            simple bad luck. For the purposes of these rules,
                            a 'hit' may be an actual direct hit, or may be due
                            to shrapnel or ricochet. In either case, the actual
                            cause of the 'hit' is abstracted for simplicity.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            If there is a hit on a vehicle that causes at least
                            one point of minor or major damage, there is a chance

                            like a car, 'that location' is considered to be any
                            hit on the vehicle. For larger vehicles, such as a
                            ship, determination of location is left to the GM.
                            Note that even one point of minor damage against a
                            vehicle has a chance of harming a passenger, even
                            though that won't actually add damage to the vehicle.
                            What counts is the number of points of damage, not the
                            levels added to the vehicle's damage track.

                            Differences in size between vehicles can be far
                            greater than that between animals (at least, in the
                            real world). In the modern world, the largest vehicles
                            are aircraft carriers of size 40+. SF starships (not
                            covered under <e>High Tech</e>) can be even larger
                            (the <e>Death Star</e> would be about Size 80).

                        <para>
                            Each vehicle mounted weapon has its own <t>Size</t>
                            which is independent of the vehicle it is mounted on.
                            Most anti-vehicle weapons (such as the main gun on
                            a tank) are <t>Size</t> 10. Secondary weapons (such
                            as a heavy machine gun) will be <t>Size</t> 5.

                    Size isn't the only statistic vehicles have in <tm>Yags</tm>.
                    As for characters, <t>Strength</t>, <t>Health</t>,
                    <t>Agility</t> and <t>Perception</t> also exist for vehicles.
                </para>

                <para>
                    <t>Strength</t> is pretty straightforward, and is a measure
                    of the vehicle's pulling power. It can be compared directly
                    against the strength of a person.

                <para>
                    <t>Health</t> is a measure of the general reliability and
                    toughness of the vehicle. A <t>Health</t> of 3 is pretty
                    standard. A fragile F1 car or broken old banger may have
                    a <t>Health</t> of 2, more rugged off-road cars or military
                    vehicles will have higher <t>Health</t>.

                    <t>Agility</t> represents how agile the vehicle is.
                    Generally though. it isn't used directly since vehicles
                    rarely drive themselves. Instead, it caps the
                    <t>Dexterity</t> of the driver (rider/pilot). It doesn't
                    affect the speed of the vehicle, but may affect how well
                    it handles at high speeds.

                <para>
                    <t>Perception</t> is only used if the vehicle has its own
                    sensor systems. For most vehicles in the High Tech era
                    sensors are limited to the Mk I eyeball, so this is zero.

                        A construct will normally have a base soak equal to

                        then this can vary. The following guide can be used
                        to determine the base soak of a vehicle or building.
                        These are guidelines only, and any values in between
                        (or outside) those given can be used.

                    <para>
                        Vehicles will generally have a <e>speed</e>, which is
                        the top speed in km/h. They also have an <e>acceleration</e>,
                        which is in km/h/s. What this means is that a motorbike
                        with an acceleration of 20 km/h/s will, from a standing
                        start, be doing 20 km/h after 1 second. After 5 seconds
                        (a round) it will be doing 100km/h. In reality acceleration
                        slows as a vehicle approaches its top speed, but this is
                        ignored for simplicity.

                        If you really want to, halve acceleration if the vehicle
                        is travelling at greater than half its top speed.

                    <para>
                        Each vehicle also has a <e>range</e>, which is how many

                        this is just an average for simplicity. If you want,

                        For purposes of combat, a vehicle has a <e>Move</e>
                        rating. As for characters, this is how far the vehicle
                        can move in a round, in metres. This is equal to
                        half the vehicle's top speed, ignoring unit conversions.
                        For example, a vehicle with a top speed of 180km/h will
                        have a <e>Move</e> of 90. This gives a speed the
                        vehicle can move at in combat without penalty.

                    Vehicle mounted weapons can range from heavy machine guns
                    to 18" naval guns and beyond. Modern autocannons can make
                    a mockery of the automatic fire rules, and the ranges and
                    damage levels mean human targets don't stand much of a

                    <title>Extreme Automatic Fire</title>

                    <para>
                        The standard rules for automatic fire assume a burst
                        size of 10 bullets, with the option of larger burst
                        sizes for really high rates of fire. Many modern
                        autocannons routinely spew out thousands of rounds
                        a minute, making the more extreme ends of the rules
                        somewhat common.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Firstly, the effects of a burst according to the number
                        of bullets in it is unaffected, maxing out at 37+.
                        An autocannon burst size of 100 bullets is no different
                        in this sense than one with 50 bullets, except it is
                        retains effectiveness at longer ranges.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        An automatic weapon halves the burst size at 10% of
                        short range, and each subsequent multiple of this.
                        A more general rule is that the base range is
                        increased to be 1% of short range per bullet in the
                        burst. An autocannon with a basic burst size of 50,
                        is fully effective out to 50% of short range. After
                        this, and for each multiple of 50% of short range,
                        the effective burst size is halved.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If an automatic weapon has a burst size greater than
                        100, then close range is capped at 100%.
                    </para>

                        <para>
                            The GAU-8 has a short range of 1km, and is rated as
                            Au-50, with a RoF of 350. Every round it can fire
                            7 bursts of 50 bullets each.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            Out to 50% of short range, or 500m, each burst is
                            counted as having 50 bullets. Out to 1km, burst
                            size is reduced to 25 bullets. Up to 1.5km, it is
                            12 bullets, 6 bullets out to 2km, 3 out to 2.5km
                            and 1 out to 3km.

                        <para>
                            This gives a maximum effective range for the weapon
                            of 3.5km, shorter than the 8km long range. However,
                            the <e>following fire</e> technique can increase
                            this effective range. Otherwise, the chance of actually
                            hitting anything 8km away is pretty much zero.

                        If they do explosive damage (e.g., HE rounds), then
                        also add +2 size for the first 1m of explosive radius,

                and fuss. Occasionally however, the journey is the interesting
                bit, but modelling a high speed car chase can be tricky to

                    There are a lot of rules here, and if you really want to

                    something really exciting happens. You can use a simple
                    target number, or have an opposed check between two
                    people. That's where most games leave it, and in many

                    A good driver can get out of situations an excellent

                <para>
                    Firstly, when driving a normal route, without any attempt
                    at high speed or evasion, there is a simple
                    <t>Perception</t> based <e>Drive</e> check made every hour
                    at a target of 10. This is not capped by the vehicle's
                    statistics, and mostly comes down to the driver being aware
                    of what is going on around them. After a number of checks
                    equal to their <t>Will</t>, they gain a level of exhaustion,
                    and a further level every 2 checks after that.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If a check is failed, then the driver must make an immediate
                    <t>Dexterity</t> based driving check at the same difficulty.
                    If this succeeds, then an accident is narrowly avoided.
                    Otherwise, there is a collision.
                    If they have a skill of at least 4, then they may opt to gain
                    a level of exhaustion to halve the difficulty of the second
                    check.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If the driver wishes to travel faster than normal, then they
                    can reduce journey time by 20%, but the target difficulties
                    are increased by +5. Each further 5% reduction increases the
                    difficulty by an extra +5 (e.g., difficulty 45 to halve the
                    journey time). If the speed is pushing the limits of the car,
                    add a further +5.
                </para>

                <para>
                    There is also the option to drive carefully. Increase journey
                    time by 50% to reduce difficulty by 5. Double journey time to
                    reduce difficulty by 10.

                    When the vehicles reach a point of interest (such

                    check is required. Firstly though, the GM needs to
                    determine the safe speed for this action, then
                    all drivers get to choose the speed they're
                    attempting around it.

                        Alice and Bob are both taking part in a street

                        heading down a stretch of open round with a
                        T-junction at the end.

                    <para>
                        The GM decides that a safe speed for this
                        corner is 20kph. Alice tries to take the junction
                        at 30kph, and Bob goes for 25kph.

                        For Bob, it's a simple difficulty 20 check, which
                        he makes without too much difficulty and comes out

                        33. She needs to immediately make a second check
                        to avoid a crash, and she decides to take a point
                        of Fatigue to halve the difficulty. She makes the
                        second check, but is shaken from the experience,
                        and comes out of the junction at 20kph (half her
                        attempted speed because of the first failure).

                Sensors, in particular radar, came into use during TL 6,

                <para>
                    A sensor system has a <e>Perception</e> statistic which
                    represents its basic ability to detect things, much like
                    characters do. For a mechanical sensor, this rating is based
                    on the size of the system.

                <para>
                    A system which is 10 cubic metres in size has a base
                    <e>Perception</e> of 3. Every ten fold increase in volume
                    gives a +3 bonus to <e>Perception</e>. Such sensors are
                    considered to be vehicle scale.

                    The ability of a sensor to actually detect things (which
                    includes sensitivity, and the ability to tell noise from a
                    real signal) is given as the <e>skill rating</e> of the
                    sensor system. This is generally based on technology level,
                    but also modified by quality.

                    A basic TL 6 sensor system has a skill of 1. This is increased

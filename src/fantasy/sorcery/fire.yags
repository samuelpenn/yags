            The domain of fire includes all that is hot and combustible.
            It represents speed, energy and vitality as well as the
            burning flames of fire. It can inflame passions and cause
            fevers.

                You create a brief spark that can ignite whatever you touch.
                Materials which are highly flammable, such as oil, tinder or
                dry paper will immediately burst into flame. If the target is
                larger than the size affected, then only a portion of the
                target will immediately ignite. In the case of highly
                flammable materials, the fire will very quickly spread to
                the rest of the target though.

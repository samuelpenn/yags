                Through a process that began in the 17th century, and began to
                accelerate in the 19th, the 20th century saw a huge increase
                in the rate of technological advancement that made massive
                changes to the way people lived within a single generation.
                The early 20th century saw the first air planes,
                the mechanisation of warfare, the mass production of cars
                and instantaneous long distance communication coming into the
                hands of the masses.

                <tm>Yags High Tech</tm> covers the equipment available during
                the period from the early 20th century (Technology Level 6)
                through to the early 21st century (TL 8). Though it is barely
                more than 100 years, there is a huge change in the type of
                items available. However, they are all close enough to the
                present to be considered <e>Modern</e>, and for most people to
                have a vague understanding of what these periods in history
                were like.
            </para>

            <para>
                <tm>High Tech</tm> concerns itself mostly with those things
                that require in-game statistics, such as weapons and vehicles.
                Since vehicles become so predominant during these periods,
                a detailed set of rules on the use of vehicles within

                <para>
                    The technology levels in <tm>Yags</tm> are meant as a
                    rough guide as to when an item, skill or knowledge becomes
                    available for use within the game. The date ranges given
                    are based on 'Western Civilisation', and there is always
                    a certain fuzziness around the transition from one period
                    to the next.

                <para>
                    Though Europe and North America are currently TL 8, there
                    are still TL 0 (stone age) civilisations in the world, and
                    many smaller countries might still be classed as TL 7, or
                    even TL 6.

                    The technology level defines the base level of technology
                    that a culture can support itself, and may be radically
                    different from the technology actually available. There
                    are many African nations where mobile phones are a common
                    means of communicating and where farmers regularly look
                    up grain prices on the internet, but the TL of the culture
                    itself may be 2 or 3. Just because they don't have the
                    knowledge to build a steam engine, doesn't mean they can't
                    make use of (or even know how to repair) high tech equipment
                    purchased from others.

                <para>
                    Where prices are given, they are given for the TL when
                    the item was introduced. Most items will reduce in price
                    at later TLs, though if they become generally unavailable
                    then prices may well increase.

                        Covering the period from 1900 to 1945, TL 6 sees the
                        introduction of cars and planes on a scale which
                        affects the lives of everyone.

                    <para>
                        From the point of view of being the setting for a
                        campaign, TL 6 has a number of unique advantages.
                        Firstly, it has just the right amount of technology
                        to allow things to be possible, without it being
                        quite prevalent enough to close down other options.

                        Communication around the world is possible, but
                        possible to prevent on a regular basis without
                        stretching disbelief. Fast air travel exists, but
                        is limited. In America, you have the extremes of
                        high society and abject poverty rubbing shoulders
                        with each other. Two world wars provide plenty of
                        plot hooks, and the '30s provide obvious villains
                        in the form of the Nazis.

                            In a science fiction setting, it is relatively
                            easy for a culture to achieve TL 6 if they are
                            pre-equipped with the right scientific knowledge.
                            As long as skilled craftsman are available, the
                            machines that were common in this period didn't
                            require high levels of automation for production,
                            and could be produced manually.

                            They would rely on trade with more populous worlds to
                            obtain more advanced tools, medicine and machines.

                        Space travel, computers and the wide adoption of
                        television also changed culture considerably.

                        TL 7 provides a number of good possibilities for

                        set around espionage, covert operations and outright
                        shooting wars. The end of the Cold War period
                        actually made it a lot harder to come up with

                        fight. It wasn't long before new enemies were found,
                        and by the early 21st century there is again room for
                        plenty of covert operations, though the nature of such

                        The big issue with TL 8 adventures is that communication

                            It requires raw materials, advanced factories, precision
                            machines and the ability to produce sensitive electronic

                            above TL 0. AK-47s are cheap and easy to use, and have
                            become the staple of tribal warfare. As technology advances
                            though, it becomes harder to support it without the
                            full set of tools. A TL 7 car can be fixed and maintained
                            by someone with a hammer and a bit of knowledge. Fixing the

                    The least obvious are the codes listed in the

                    As weapon technology has progressed, so has that for armour.
                    For much of the high tech period however, armour has lagged
                    behind since it has been difficult to make armour effective
                    enough to stop high velocity bullets which is light enough
                    to be wearable on a modern battlefield.

                <para>
                    The first attempts at bulletproof armour where made in the
                    Great War, but weren't particularly successful. Things
                    improved in World War II, but attempts were bulky and

                    With the advent of new materials, body armour has improved
                    greatly since the 2nd half of the
                    20th century though, and a number of different options

                            attacks, and isn't halved against weapons rated as

                            Armour rated 'NBC' gives protection against nuclear,

                            that it is a sealed suit, with either a filtration

                The first half of the 20th century saw some of the most
                destructive and far reaching wars humanity has yet been
                subjected to. They propelled the USA to the centre stage
                of world affairs, and began a cold war which was to

                Technology level 6 is considered to start in 1900, though
                an equally valid argument could be made for any date in the
                few decades immediately prior to that. If TL 5 saw the rise
                of industrial machines, so TL 6 comes to be dominated by
                consumer machines. Horses give way to cars. Steamboats to
                planes. Telegrams to telephones. Newspapers to television.
                Antibiotics, vaccines, radar and computers are invented in
                TL 6. It is the beginning of the modern world.

                        The science of this time is advanced, but not that

                        to have a good understanding of all things that are
                        required for such a culture. This means that knocking
                        a culture back beyond TL 6 is going to be difficult,
                        unless the surviving population base is really limited.

                        with a spanner. Many post-apocalyptic settings are
                        probably going to fall back to TL 6 after the
                        infrastructure of their technological society is

                        a post-apocalyptic setting where who survived is going
                        to be pretty random, colonists will have been chosen for
                        having the right set of useful skills. So though the
                        population base is smaller, the knowledge to keep things
                        working is more likely to be there.

                    Despite the mechanisation of killing, the horse and
                    cart was still a major contributor to transportation
                    during World War I. Iron Clad battleships, early
                    aircraft and the first tanks were most spectacular
                    vehicles of the war.

                    Civilian transportation also began to take off during
                    this period, and the Ford Model T had been introduced
                    only a few years prior to the start of the war.

                    of many technologies that would become the basis
                    for TL 7. The late war years are pretty much on
                    the cusp of TL 6/TL 7, but are considered to be
                    late TL 6 rather than early TL 7.

            <para>
                World War II had spurred the development of new technologies
                that became the defining achievements of TL7. Computers,
                electronics, nuclear power and space flight all become
                achievable and even in common everyday use, bringing about
                some of the greatest changes in technology never before
                witnessed.
            </para>

            <para>
                With the advent of the Cold War, both Russia and America had
                the opportunity to engage in an arms race and indirect conflict
                which caused no end of suffering, but which provides plenty
                of opportunity for gaming.

            <para>
                From 1980 to 2020, TL 8 covers the present day. Huge
                advancements in computer technology become apparent to
                the general population over this period, as communications
                and information technology begin to reform society.
            </para>

            <para>
                Computer assistance makes its way into vehicles and weapons,
                and remotely operated drones make the battle field safer
                (for those who have the drones). As the threat of full scale
                nuclear war diminishes, so small scale tactical weapons
                are favoured over massive destructive ability.

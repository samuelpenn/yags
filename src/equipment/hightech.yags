                Through a process that began in the 17th century, and began to
                accelerate in the 19th, the 20th century saw a huge increase
                in the rate of technological advancement that made massive
                changes to the way people lived within a single generation.
                The early 20th century saw the first air planes,
                the mechanisation of warfare, the mass production of cars
                and instantaneous long distance communication coming into the
                hands of the masses.

            <para>
                <tm>YAGS High Tech</tm> covers the equipment available during
                the period from the early 20th century (Technology Level 6)
                through to the early 21st century (TL 8). Though it is barely
                more than 100 years, there is a huge change in the type of
                items available. However, they are all close enough to the
                present to be considered <e>Modern</e>, and for most people to
                have a vague understanding of what these periods in history
                were like.
            </para>

            <para>
                <tm>High Tech</tm> concerns itself mostly with those things
                that require in-game statistics, such as weapons and vehicles.
                Since vehicles become so predominant during these periods,
                a detailed set of rules on the use of vehicles within
                <tm>YAGS</tm> are also included.

                <para>
                    The technology levels in <tm>YAGS</tm> are meant as a
                    rough guide as to when an item, skill or knowledge becomes
                    available for use within the game. The date ranges given
                    are based on 'Western Civilisation', and there is always
                    a certain fuzziness around the transition from one period
                    to the next.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Though Europe and North America are currently TL 8, there
                    are still TL 0 (stone age) civilisations in the world, and
                    many smaller countries might still be classed as TL 7, or
                    even TL 6. In many games, it may well be that the adventures
                    are happening in these less technologically advanced countries,
                    so though PCs have access to high tech weapons and satellite
                    phones, the culture around them has a combination of spears and
                    AK-47s.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The technology level defines the base level of technology
                    that a culture can support itself, and may be radically
                    different from the technology actually available. There
                    are many African nations where mobile phones are a common
                    means of communicating and where farmers regularly look
                    up grain prices on the internet, but the TL of the culture
                    itself may be 2 or 3. Just because they don't have the
                    knowledge to build a steam engine, doesn't mean they can't
                    make use of (or even know how to repair) high tech equipment
                    purchased from others.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Where prices are given, they are given for the TL when
                    the item was introduced. Most items will reduce in price
                    at later TLs, though if they become generally unavailable
                    then prices may well increase.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Prices are given in USD ($), again at time of introduction.

                        Covering the period from 1900 to 1945, TL 6 sees the
                        introduction of cars and planes on a scale which
                        affects the lives of everyone.

                        From the point of view of being the setting for a
                        campaign, TL 6 has a number of unique advantages.
                        Firstly, it has just the right amount of technology
                        to allow things to be possible, without it being
                        quite prevalent enough to close down other options.

                        Communication around the world is possible, but
                        possible to prevent on a regular basis without
                        stretching disbelief. Fast air travel exists, but
                        is limited. In America, you have the extremes of
                        high society and abject poverty rubbing shoulders
                        with each other. Two world wars provide plenty of
                        plot hooks, and the '30s provide obvious villains
                        in the form of the Nazis.

                            In a science fiction setting, it is relatively
                            easy for a culture to achieve TL 6 if they are
                            pre-equipped with the right scientific knowledge.
                            As long as skilled craftsman are available, the
                            machines that were common in this period didn't
                            require high levels of automation for production,
                            and could be produced manually.

                            They would rely on trade with more populous worlds to
                            obtain more advanced tools, medicine and machines.

                        the only defining characteristic of TL 7 however.
                        Space travel, computers and the wide adoption of
                        television also changed culture considerably.

                        TL 7 provides a number of good possibilities for

                        War. There is plenty of opportunity for adventures
                        set around espionage, covert operations and outright
                        shooting wars. The end of the Cold War period
                        actually made it a lot harder to come up with

                        fight. It wasn't long before new enemies were found,

                        plenty of covert operations, though the nature of such

                            a large population, in the order of 100 million people.
                            It requires raw materials, advanced factories, precision
                            machines and the ability to produce sensitive electronic

                            Some technology however is easy to share with low tech
                            neighbours. Mobile phones are ubiquitous almost throughout
                            the entire world, even in cultures which are barely
                            above TL 0. AK-47s are cheap and easy to use, and have
                            become the staple of tribal warfare. As technology advances
                            though, it becomes harder to support it without the
                            full set of tools. A TL 7 car can be fixed and maintained
                            by someone with a hammer and a bit of knowledge. Fixing the

                Sooner or later, everybody dies. As an 'adventuring hero' you will

                Once you reach 30, you need to make an ageing roll each year.
                This roll can be done on your birthday, or at the end of the
                winter season. For long running campaigns which are built around
                yearly events, it is generally easiest to assume that everyone
                rolls at the same time of year. The results of the ageing will
                happen sometime over the following year.

                    An ageing roll is equal to 1d20 + the number of full decades
                    you have lived. On your 30th through 39th year, you will roll
                    1d20 + 3. There are modifiers to this based on your current
                    state of health and living conditions.

                The various reasons which we have enumerated lead us to believe
                that the new radioactive substance contains a new element which
                we propose to give the name of radium.

                The world is a dangerous place, which is often trying to find new
                ways of killing us, or at least making life more exciting. It is
                during the <e>High Tech</e> era that we began to discover and
                understand some of these new ways, from radiation sickness to
                nerve poisons and biological warfare.

                    Radiation begins to be understood at the start of TL 6, though
                    it is not until the end of TL 6, with the dropping of the first
                    atomic bombs, that the full horrors of radiation become understood
                    by the population at large. During the early years of the 20th
                    century it was actually believed that radiation was good for you,
                    and radioactive drinks were marketed as a health benefit.

                <para>
                    There are many ways to measure radiation, the most common being
                    the <e>Gray</e> and the <e>Sievert</e>. These are not simply different
                    units, but different ways of measuring radiation so there isn't a
                    direct conversion factor between them. For simplicity, <tm>YAGS</tm>
                    uses a <s>Radiation</s> score for someone who has been exposed
                    to radiation. This starts at zero, and 100 or more is considered
                    fatal, which is about equivalent to 5 <e>Sieverts</e> or
                    30 <e>Grays</e>.

                    Radiation sickness comes in two forms - <e>acute</e> and <e>chronic</e>.
                    Acute radiation sickness consist of health effects which manifest within
                    24 hours of being irradiated. Chronic sickness will show up months or
                    years later.

                        If you are irradiated, then you will gain a <e>Radiation Dose</e>
                        score which will build up each time you suffer further radiation
                        exposure. Minor exposure may have little or no short term effect,
                        but over time can lead to death from organ failure, cancers or
                        other long term health symptoms.

                        How serious these dosages are depend on how quickly you
                        receive them. Gained over a long period of time (such as by
                        living in a radioactive wasteland) they are likely to cause
                        cancer, killing you in decades. The same dose over a few
                        minutes can lead to acute radiation syndrome, which can
                        kill you in days.

                    Though explosives start being used in the West during the
                    medieval period, they really come into their own during the
                    19th and 20th centuries where they are used to level entire
                    cities. Explosives generally cause damage either through
                    fragmentation or concussive effects. The difference in game
                    terms is that fragmentation explosives have a much larger
                    'kill radius'.

                    property of <s>Ex-X</s>, where <s>X</s> is the base radius
                    of the explosion.

                        Small scale explosives are designed to affect human

                        equivalent of TNT. This is generally more than enough
                        to kill a human, so most anti-personnel devices are much
                        smaller than this.

                    As weapon technology has progressed, so has that for armour.
                    For much of the high tech period however, armour has lagged
                    behind since it has been difficult to make armour effective
                    enough to stop high velocity bullets which is light enough
                    to be wearable on a modern battlefield.

                    The first attempts at bulletproof armour where made in the
                    Great War, but weren't particularly successful. Things
                    improved in World War II, but attempts were bulky and

                    20th century though, and a number of different options

                The first half of the 20th century saw some of the most
                destructive and far reaching wars humanity has yet been
                subjected to. They propelled the USA to the centre stage
                of world affairs, and began a cold war which was to
                dominate the second half of the century.

                Technology level 6 is considered to start in 1900, though
                an equally valid argument could be made for any date in the
                few decades immediately prior to that. If TL 5 saw the rise
                of industrial machines, so TL 6 comes to be dominated by
                consumer machines. Horses give way to cars. Steamboats to
                planes. Telegrams to telephones. Newspapers to television.
                Antibiotics, vaccines, radar and computers are invented in
                TL 6. It is the beginning of the modern world.

                    anywhere in the world is relatively easy, and telegrams
                    or even telephones can be used to ask for aid, or update

                    that has a telephone. Out in the woods, you're on your

                        museums. As previously mentioned, getting to places is
                        much easier than in previous eras, but it is still hard
                        enough to make it dangerous (and therefore interesting

                        they wouldn't be able to in a more modern period, but again
                        there are far fewer laws to protect you.

                        provide an easily identifiable bad guy (at least from a
                        modern perspective) for a black and white morality
                        conflict. The Great War is more complex, and most players
                        probably don't know as much about this period as they do
                        World War II, which can either be a benefit or a problem
                        for games set in the earlier period.

                        It is also the time of HP Lovecraft, and his brand of
                        horror fits the period well.

                        Horror is easy to fit into either of the Wars, and adding

                        work well.

                        The science of this time is advanced, but not that
                        advanced. It is possible for a small number of people
                        to have a good understanding of all things that are
                        required for such a culture. This means that knocking
                        a culture back beyond TL 6 is going to be difficult,
                        unless the surviving population base is really limited.

                        The technology of the period is also mechanical, and
                        therefore can be fiddled with and fixed by a mechanic
                        with a spanner. Many post-apocalyptic settings are
                        probably going to fall back to TL 6 after the
                        infrastructure of their technological society is
                        destroyed.

                        a post-apocalyptic setting where who survived is going
                        to be pretty random, colonists will have been chosen for
                        having the right set of useful skills. So though the
                        population base is smaller, the knowledge to keep things
                        working is more likely to be there.

                    more effective ways of killing people, and WWII developed

                        Though guns were the most common form of weapon in this
                        period, people still used more primitive weapons. Whether
                        it is a gangster bringing a knife to a gun fight, or a
                        desperate fall back option once you've run out of bullets,
                        knives and sharp sticks will still be encountered.

                        Despite the mechanisation of killing, the horse and

                        during World War I. Iron Clad battleships, early
                        aircraft and the first tanks were most spectacular
                        vehicles of the war.

            <para>
                World War II had spurred the development of new technologies
                that became the defining achievements of TL7. Computers,
                electronics, nuclear power and space flight all become
                achievable and even in common everyday use, bringing about
                some of the greatest changes in technology never before
                witnessed.

            <para>
                With the advent of the Cold War, both Russia and America had
                the opportunity to engage in an arms race and indirect conflict
                which caused no end of suffering, but which provides plenty
                of opportunity for gaming.

                From 1980 to 2020, TL 8 covers the present day. Huge
                advancements in computer technology become apparent to
                the general population over this period, as communications
                and information technology begin to reform society.
            </para>

            <para>
                Computer assistance makes its way into vehicles and weapons,
                and remotely operated drones make the battle field safer
                (for those who have the drones). As the threat of full scale
                nuclear war diminishes, so small scale tactical weapons
                are favoured over massive destructive ability.

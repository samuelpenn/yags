                This is the future of Hollywood Science Fiction. Actually,
                it's not quite that bad, but the <e>SciFi</e> label is used
                to describe a future more suited to action and adventure
                amongst interstellar communities, than to one embedded in
                a virtual reality simulation running in a Matrioshka Brain.
                Laser guns and space ships if you like, rather than hard
                science fiction.

                <s>YAGS</s> measures the technology available to a campaign
                with technology levels (TLs), where the modern era around
                the start of the 21st millennium is TL 8. For the technology
                of the 20th century, see <e>YAGS High Tech</e>, and other
                articles will cover earlier periods. TL 9 and above are in
                the realms of the future, so is purely fictional.

                Everything here is suited to <e>SciFi</e> style campaigns,
                with faster than light travel, ridiculous energy production
                and weird new forms of matter. It may be suitable for
                campaigns built around <e>Traveller</e>, <e>Babylon 5</e>
                or the <e>Foundation</e> series, though isn't particularly
                suited to settings such as those of <e>Revalation Space</e>
                by Alastair Reynolds or <e>Queendom of Sol</e> by Wil McCarthy.
                It's aimed at the harder end of Hollywood SciFi, rather than
                the type of futures portrayed in modern SF books. If you want
                a harder, grittier future than <e>Ultra Tech</e> will be
                designed to cover this, following a branch of future
                technology where computational power is not restricted by
                storytelling requirements.

                The big requirement here is that the future is still about people.
                Computer technology is limited so that humanity doesn't
                vanish up its own singularity, thereby preventing the ability
                to have high adventure in interstellar communities.

                    <s>YAGS SciFi</s> generally covers TL 9 through to TL 19,
                    though the higher end of the scale is getting pretty close
                    to 'magic'. TL 10 is considered a Kardashev Type I
                    civilisation (utilising all the energy available to a planet),
                    and TL 20 is considered Kardashev Type II (utilising all the

                        This covers the technology that becomes available
                        over the rest of the 21st century, from about 2020
                        to 2100. Computers continue to improve, genetics and
                        medical science make some great leaps but the biggest
                        change is in energy storage, which is needed to power
                        the smart devices of the future.

                        Guns still fire bullets, mostly with the help of
                        chemical explosions. Travel to orbit becomes cheaper
                        and easier, but space travel across the solar system
                        is still hard. Ion drives and nuclear rockets are
                        generally used.

                        By TL 10 we can consume the whole energy resources of
                        a planet, with a combination of fission, fusion, solar
                        and other power sources. Interplanetary travel becomes
                        easy, but the limits of computational technology are
                        being approached. By the end of TL 10, the first FTL
                        drives are developed. Bodily organs can be grown on
                        demand in vats, as can food.

                        Guns fire bullets, often propelled by EM gauss effects.
                        Laser weapons are common in specialist cases. Nuclear
                        powered plasma drives are the typical means of space

                        Star travel becomes reliable as the technology improves,
                        but it is still slow. Computer technology is approaching
                        a stasis, but medical science is removing the need for
                        cybernetics, allowing limb re-growth and some limited
                        anti-agathics.

                    <para>
                        Gauss and laser weapons tend to be equally common, and
                        materials technology starts to improve body armour. In space,
                        lasers and particle beams dominate.

                    <para>
                        Star travel becomes faster, and cheaper. Manipulation of
                        the weak force allows for nuclear damper technology, and
                        new forms of matter can be created. Medical technology
                        has improved to the point where most things are survivable
                        if you can get to a hospitable in time. Cybernetics seems
                        like a passing fad, since organic replacements can be
                        just as good.

                        required, anti-matter is the way to go.

                        unattainable. Interstellar travel is cheap and readily

                The number of options available to those who want to kill or harm
                others tend to proliferate as technology advances. We have moved
                from requiring strength of arm as a measure of killing power, to
                the equaliser of chemical powered kinetic and explosive weapons.
                Experiments with more exotic ways of killing people, which started
                in TL 8, finally reach fruition in TL 9 and beyond.

                        As arms companies search desperately for the next 'killer'
                        weapon technology, it becomes apparent that one of the most

                        of heavy metal at them very quickly. This is as true in TL 16

                            purposes. They work by accelerating a charged metal slug

                        <para>
                            Laser weapons are generally the first departure away from
                            propelling a slug of metal towards the target. As a
                            'direct-energy' weapon, a laser directly converts energy
                            into killing power. Though this isn't as efficient as it
                            may sound, laser beams have definite advantages.

                        <para>
                            Lasers are very accurate. On the scale most gun fights are
                            fought, lasers are unaffected by wind and gravity. They do
                            not lose their attack bonus at medium and long range, and
                            neither do they suffer increased fumble chance. Laser weapons
                            also tend to have a very high <e>increment</e> attribute.
                        </para>

                            The <e>medium</e> and <e>long</e> will be double and triple
                            the <e>short</e> range of the weapon. The beam does not stop
                            at <e>long</e> range however, and will continue beyond this.
                            Each multiple of <e>short</e> range beyond <e>long</e>

                            are affected by moisture, and ranges are at least halved in
                            mist or fog, and quartered in heavy rain. Reduce range by a

                            have relatively short range, since they lose energy to the
                            atmosphere quite readily. They explode on impact, causing

                The progression of technology through the 21st century has
                been one of iterative improvements over what has gone before.
                There's little which is completely unexpected, though changes

                    your reputation and friends are governed by your standing
                    on these social networks. Privacy crumbles under the onslaught
                    of location based services, advertising and automated status
                    updates. As new generations are born into this world, and

                    Part of this new world is aided by the invention of superior
                    new energy storage technologies, so even the most power hungry
                    smart phones can last a week between recharges. Consistency

                    On a larger scale, there is a greater use of energy sources
                    such as solar, wind and tidal power as a more flexible and
                    distributed power grid is developed. Fossil fuels are still
                    heavily used, though high performance electric cars begin to
                    become practical with better batteries. Towards the end of
                    TL 9, fusion power starts to come online, though most power
                    stations are proof of concept designs serving small towns.

                    The killing ability of man portable weapons plateaus during
                    late TL8 and early TL9. The lack of progress in personal
                    armour means there isn't a necessity for weapons to become
                    more deadly. Instead, they are lighter, more reliable and
                    somewhat cleverer.

                    Most small arms switch to case-less ammunition, with some
                    larger rifles moving to gauss or even laser. For the most
                    part, the good old chemical powered slug thrower is still the
                    most efficient in terms of weight, cost and effectiveness.

                    Armour becomes a bit lighter and a bit more effective, but
                    not by much. Richer nations can afford powered hard shell
                    armour towards the end of TL9, but since they're also the
                    ones making the newer weapons and they're only going up
                    against lightly armoured opponents there isn't a drive to
                    modify small arms to be effective against such targets.

                    drones and net-enabled combat troopers can bring effective
                    fire down on an enemy position quickly and technically without

                    By TL 10 cities are smart. Automated surveillance is
                    everywhere, monitoring where people are and what they are
                    doing. This flow of information allows for a degree of
                    efficiency not seen before, but also limits the privacy
                    available to everyone. Many people record their whole
                    lives, video and audio captured though implants inserted
                    soon after birth. The legal ramifications are massive,
                    and there's either a crack down on such technology or

                    Fusion power is the most common form of large scale power
                    generation, but power is reclaimed via other means on a
                    smaller scale. Solar, tidal and wind power grabs what it
                    can and feeds it into national energy grids in a greatly
                    distributed system of power generation. Highly efficient
                    energy storage systems can store power locally, minimising
                    the effects of national failures, and reducing the need

                    and common. This in turn requires more powerful small arms
